# Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity:

## Roles & Responsibilities of an entry-level cybersecurity analyst:

Security analysts are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.

1. Protection computer & Network Systems.  
2. Installing prevention software.  
3. Conducting periodic security audits.

Two sides to work on:

1. Operations: Responding to detections and doing investigations.   
2. Projects: Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections. 

Playbook: A list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents.   
Two types of skills:

1. Transferable: Skills from other areas that can apply to different careers.  
   1. Communication  
   2. Collaboration  
   3. Analysis  
   4. Problem Solving  
2. Technical: Skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures and policies.   
   1. Programming Languages  
   2. Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) tools  
   3. Computer Forensics

## The importance of cybersecurity:

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information used to infer and individual’s identity.   
Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII): Specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition. 

## Past Cybersecurity Attacks:

Computer Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. 

Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks. Primary purpose is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organisation or territory.   
Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

* Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.  
* Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.  
* Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.   
* Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Attacks in the digital age:

Social engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.   
Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

* Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.  
* Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.  
* USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.   
* Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Social engineering is incredibly effective. Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

* Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.   
* Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.   
* Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.   
* Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.   
* Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.    
* Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.  
* Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

Phishing: The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying   
malicious software.   
Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

* Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.  
* Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.  
* Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.  
* Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.  
* Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Two attacks that shaped cybersecurity industry: 

1. Loveletter attack (ILOVEYOU virus)  
2. Equifax breach  
3. Morris worm

## Introduction to the 8 CISSP security domains:

1. Security & Risk Management: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law.   
2. Asset Security: Secures digital & physical assets. It’s also related to the storage, maintenance, retention & destruction of data.   
3. Security architecture & Engineering: Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.   
4. Communication & Network security: Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.   
5. Identity & Access management: Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces and logical assets, such as networks and applications.   
6. Security assessment & Testing: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.   
7. Security operations: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.   
8. Software Development: Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.   
   

## Attack Types: 

Password attack: A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

* Brute force  
* Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

Social engineering attack: Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

* Phishing  
* Smishing  
* Vishing  
* Spear phishing  
* Whaling  
* Social media phishing  
* Business Email Compromise (BEC)  
* Watering hole attack  
* USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting  
* Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

Physical attack: A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

* Malicious USB cable  
* Malicious flash drive  
* Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

Adversarial artificial intelligence: Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

Supply-chain attack: A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

Cryptographic attack: A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

* Birthday  
* Collision  
* Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

## Threat Actor Types:

A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. The types of threat actors are:  
Advanced persistent threats: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

* Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources  
* Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

Insider threats: Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

* Sabotage  
* Corruption  
* Espionage  
* Unauthorized data access or leaks 

Hacktivists: Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

* Demonstrations  
* Propaganda  
* Social change campaigns  
* Fame

## Hacker types:

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

* Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.  
* Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.  
* Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.  
New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

* To learn and enhance their hacking skills  
* To seek revenge  
* To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.  
There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

## Security Frameworks and Controls:

Security frameworks: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.  
Purpose of security frameworks: 

1. Protecting PII  
2. Security financial information  
3. Identifying security weaknesses   
4. Managing organizational risks  
5. Aligning security with business goals

Components of security frameworks: 

1. Identify and documenting security goals  
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals  
3. Implementing security processes  
4. Monitoring and communicating results

Security controls: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 

CIA Triad: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Triad. 

1. Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.   
2. Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.   
3. Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

Asset: An item perceived as having value to an organization. 

Security Frameworks, Compliance standards and controls: 

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. 

NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) provides a process that integrates security, privacy and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \- North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC): FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC.   
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®): FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

Center for Internet Security (CIS®): CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 

1. Privacy  
2. Security   
3. Breach notification 

Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services. 

System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2): The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

* Associate  
* Supervisor  
* Manager  
* Executive  
* Vendor  
* Others 

They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA):  
 The GLBA is a U.S. law passed in 1999 that requires financial institutions to protect the privacy and security of consumers’ personal financial information. It includes rules for how companies collect, share, and safeguard data. The act has three main sections: the Financial Privacy Rule, the Safeguards Rule, and the Pretexting Provisions.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): The SOX Act was passed in 2002 to improve financial transparency and prevent corporate fraud after scandals like Enron and WorldCom. It applies mainly to publicly traded companies and enforces strict rules on financial reporting, internal controls, and data retention. It also holds executives personally accountable for the accuracy of financial statements.

United States Presidential Executive Order 14028: On May 12, 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity. Remediation efforts are directed toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to U.S. critical infrastructure.

## Ethics in Cybersecurity:

Security Ethics: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.   
Ethical Principles in Security:

1. Confidentiality: Keeping PII confidential and safe.   
2. Privacy Protections: Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.  
3. Laws: Rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.   
   

Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Confidentiality as it relates to professional ethics means that there needs to be a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.

Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. Personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) are types of personal data that can cause people harm if they are stolen. PII data is any information used to infer an individual's identity, like their name and phone number. SPII data is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines, including social security numbers and credit card numbers. To effectively safeguard PII and SPII data, security professionals hold an ethical obligation to secure private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals. 

Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. As a security professional, you will have an ethical obligation to protect your organization, its internal infrastructure, and the people involved with the organization. To do this:

* You must remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law.   
* Be transparent and just, and rely on evidence.  
* Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.   
* Stay informed and strive to advance your skills, so you can contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape.

Ethical concerns, laws and United States standpoint related to counterattacks: In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others. You can only defend. The act of counterattacking in the U.S. is perceived as an act of vigilantism. A vigilante is a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own. And because threat actors are criminals, counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm. Lastly, if the threat actor in question is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications. A hacktivist is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal. The political goal may be to promote social change or civil disobedience.   
For these reasons, the only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel.   
International standpoint on counterattacks

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

* The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.  
* The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.  
* The counterattack does not escalate the situation.  
* The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.   
To learn more about specific scenarios and ethical concerns from an international perspective, review updates provided in the Tallinn Manual online.

Ethical principles and methodologies  
Because counterattacks are generally disapproved of or illegal, the security realm has created frameworks and controls—such as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and others discussed earlier in the program—to address issues of confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws. To better understand the relationship between these issues and the ethical obligations of cybersecurity professionals, review the following key concepts as they relate to using ethics to protect organizations and the people they serve.  
As an example, consider the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is a U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information, also known as PHI, or protected health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. So, as a security professional, you might help ensure that the organization you work for adheres to both its legal and ethical obligation to inform patients of a breach if their health care data is exposed.

## Common cybersecurity tools:

Security information and event management (SIEM) tools: A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems. Depending on the amount of data you’re working with, it could take hours or days to filter through log data on your own. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  
SIEM tools provide a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze. Different SIEM tools have different dashboard types that display the information you have access to.   
SIEM tools also come with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud. Organizations may choose one hosting option over another based on a security team member’s expertise. For example, because a cloud-hosted version tends to be easier to set up, use, and maintain than an on-premise version, a less experienced security team may choose this option for their organization.

Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers): A network protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network. This means that the tool keeps a record of all the data that a computer within an organization's network encounters. Later in the program, you’ll have an opportunity to practice using some common network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) tools. 

Playbooks: A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident. Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow. Playbooks vary from one organization to the next, but they all have a similar purpose: To guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks.   
For example, consider the following scenario: You are working as a security analyst for an incident response firm. You are given a case involving a small medical practice that has suffered a security breach. Your job is to help with the forensic investigation and provide evidence to a cybersecurity insurance company. They will then use your investigative findings to determine whether the medical practice will receive their insurance payout. 

In this scenario, playbooks would outline the specific actions you need to take to conduct the investigation. Playbooks also help ensure that you are following proper protocols and procedures. When working on a forensic case, there are two playbooks you might follow:

* The first type of playbook you might consult is called the chain of custody playbook. Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. As a security analyst involved in a forensic analysis, you will work with the computer data that was breached. You and the forensic team will also need to document who, what, where, and why you have the collected evidence. The evidence is your responsibility while it is in your possession. Evidence must be kept safe and tracked. Every time evidence is moved, it should be reported. This allows all parties involved to know exactly where the evidence is at all times.  
* The second playbook your team might use is called the protecting and preserving evidence playbook. Protecting and preserving evidence is the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. As a security analyst, understanding what fragile and volatile digital evidence is, along with why there is a procedure, is critical. As you follow this playbook, you will consult the order of volatility, which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It prioritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the device in question powers off, regardless of the reason. While conducting an investigation, improper management of digital evidence can compromise and alter that evidence. When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used. For this reason, the first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data. You can preserve the data by making copies and conducting your investigation using those copies.

## Linux, Python & SQL and other cybersecurity skills:

Programming: Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Security analysts use programming languages, such as Python, to execute automation. Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. Automation also helps reduce the risk of human error.  
Another programming language used by analysts is called Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. A database is an organized collection of information or data. There can be millions of data points in a database. A data point is a specific piece of information. 

Operating systems: An operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems. They each offer different functionality and user experiences.   
Previously, you were introduced to Linux as an open-source operating system. Open source means that the code is available to the public and allows people to make contributions to improve the software. Linux is not a programming language; however, it does involve the use of a command line within the operating system. A command is an instruction telling the computer to do something. A command-line interface is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. You will learn more about Linux, including the Linux kernel and GNU, in a later course.

Web vulnerability: A web vulnerability is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.  
To stay up-to-date on the most critical risks to web applications, review the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10\.

Antivirus software: Antivirus software is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware. Depending on the type of antivirus software, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.   
Intrusion detection system 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network. The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data. Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.

Encryption: Encryption makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data. Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. Cryptographic encoding means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. Plaintext is unencrypted information and secure ciphertext is the result of encryption.    
Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representations to share information.    

Penetration testing: Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It is a thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.

# Course 2: Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

## The 8 CISSP Domains:

Domain one: Security and risk management  
All organizations must develop their security posture. Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's security posture include:

* Security goals and objectives  
* Risk mitigation processes  
* Compliance  
* Business continuity plans  
* Legal regulations  
* Professional and organizational ethics

Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

* Incident response  
* Vulnerability management  
* Application security  
* Cloud security  
* Infrastructure security

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Domain two: Asset security  
Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data. Because the loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data they hold is essential. Conducting a security impact analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset. Security analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.

Domain three: Security architecture and engineering	  
This domain focuses on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization’s assets and data. Security architects and engineers create these processes.  
One important aspect of this domain is the concept of shared responsibility. Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:

* Threat modeling  
* Least privilege  
* Defense in depth  
* Fail securely  
* Separation of duties  
* Keep it simple  
* Zero trust  
* Trust but verify

An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management (SIEM) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.

Domain four: Communication and network security  
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications.   
Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization’s networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organization’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.

Domain five: Identity and access management  
The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.  
Essentially, IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.

Domain six: Security assessment and testing   
The security assessment and testing domain focuses on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor.   
This domain suggests that organizations conduct security control testing, as well as collect and analyze data. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of conducting security audits to monitor for and reduce the probability of a data breach. To contribute to these types of tasks, cybersecurity professionals may be tasked with auditing user permissions to validate that users have the correct levels of access to internal systems.

Domain seven: Security operations   
The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. This includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:

* Training and awareness  
* Reporting and documentation  
* Intrusion detection and prevention  
* SIEM tools     
* Log management  
* Incident management  
* Playbooks  
* Post-breach forensics  
* Reflecting on lessons learned

The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amounts of data being accessed from an organization's internal network, outside of normal working hours. Once a threat is identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors.  

Domain eight: Software development security  
The software development security domain is focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications. Having secure applications helps deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.  
Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release. To achieve security, the software development process must have security in mind at each step. Security cannot be an afterthought.  
Performing application security tests can help ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated accordingly. Having a system in place to test the programming conventions, software executables, and security measures embedded in the software is necessary. Having quality assurance and pen tester professionals ensure the software has met security and performance standards is also an essential part of the software development process. For example, an entry-level analyst working for a pharmaceutical company might be asked to make sure encryption is properly configured for a new medical device that will store private patient data. 

## Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities: 

Risk management  
A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets. An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization. Assets can be digital or physical. Examples of digital assets include the personal information of employees, clients, or vendors, such as: 

* Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or unique national identification numbers assigned to individuals   
* Dates of birth  
* Bank account numbers  
* Mailing addresses

Examples of physical assets include:

* Payment kiosks  
* Servers  
* Desktop computers  
* Office spaces

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:

* Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity  
* Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether  
* Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage  
* Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk

Additionally, organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Examples of frameworks commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) and Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST).  
Following are some common types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities you’ll help organizations manage as a security professional.

Threats: A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. As an entry-level security analyst, your job is to help defend the organization’s assets from inside and outside threats. Therefore, understanding common types of threats is important to an analyst’s daily work. As a reminder, common threats include:

* Insider threats: Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.  
* Advanced persistent threats (APTs): A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

Risks: A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc. 

Risk asset types: 

* Low-risk asset: A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.  
* Medium-risk asset: A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.  
* High-risk asset: A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization’s assets, including:

* External risk: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information  
* Internal risk: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk  
* Legacy systems: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.  
* Multiparty risk: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.  
* Software compliance/licensing: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner

There are many resources, such as the NIST, that provide lists of cybersecurity risks. Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications, which is updated regularly.  
Note: The OWASP’s common attack types list contains three new risks for the years 2017 to 2021: insecure design, software and data integrity failures, and server-side request forgery. This update emphasizes the fact that security is a constantly evolving field. It also demonstrates the importance of staying up to date on current threat actor tactics and techniques, so you can be better prepared to manage these types of risks.

Vulnerabilities: A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems. Some vulnerabilities include:

* ProxyLogon: A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.  
* ZeroLogon: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.  
* Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.  
* PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.  
* Security logging and monitoring failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it  
* Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.

As an entry-level security analyst, you might work in vulnerability management, which is monitoring a system to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Although patches and updates may exist, if they are not applied, intrusions can still occur. For this reason, constant monitoring is important. The sooner an organization identifies a vulnerability and addresses it by patching it or updating their systems, the sooner it can be mitigated, reducing the organization’s exposure to the vulnerability.

## More About Frameworks and Controls:

Biometrics are unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity.  
Vishing is the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Frameworks and controls  
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe. 

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someone’s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.

Specific frameworks and controls  
There are many different frameworks and controls that organizations can use to remain compliant with regulations and achieve their security goals. Frameworks covered in this reading are the Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) and the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001\. Several common security controls, used alongside these types of frameworks, are also explained. 

Cyber Threat Framework (CTF):  
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001:  
An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001\. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture. 

Controls  
Controls are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.

1. Encryption: Process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format which is unreadable to both humans and computers.   
2. Authentication: Process of verifying who someone or something is.  
3. Authorisation: Concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. 

Examples of physical controls:  
Gates, fences, and locks  
Security guards  
Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors  
Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

Examples of technical controls:  
Firewalls  
MFA  
Antivirus software

Examples of administrative controls:  
Separation of duties  
Authorization  
Asset classification

## More About the CIA Triad:

Previously, you were introduced to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and how it helps organizations consider and mitigate risk. In this reading, you will learn how cybersecurity analysts use the CIA triad in the workplace. 

The CIA triad for analysts  
The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It is made up of three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organizations work toward upholding: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful security posture, which refers to an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. 

Confidentiality: Confidentiality is the idea that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. In an organization, confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data. 

Integrity: Integrity is the idea that the data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable. Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential. One way to verify data integrity is through   
cryptography which is used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it (NIST, 2022). Another example of how an organization might implement integrity is by enabling encryption, which is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Encryption can be used to prevent access and ensure data, such as messages on an organization's internal chat platform, cannot be tampered with.  

Availability: Availability is the idea that data is accessible to those who are authorized to use it. When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used when needed. In the workplace, this could mean that the organization allows remote employees to access its internal network to perform their jobs. It’s worth noting that access to data on the internal network is still limited, depending on what type of access employees need to do their jobs. If, for example, an employee works in the organization’s accounting department, they might need access to corporate accounts but not data related to ongoing development projects.

## More About the NIST CSF:

NIST CSF: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.   
Consists of 6 important core functions: 

1. Govern: This function emphasizes the importance of strong cybersecurity governance across all levels of the organization. It's about establishing and maintaining the structures and processes needed to effectively manage cybersecurity risk. This includes things like setting clear cybersecurity objectives, ensuring leadership commitment, developing and implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy, and continuously improving cybersecurity performance.  
2. Identify: The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization’s people and assets.  
3. Protect: The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.   
4. Detect: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.   
5. Respond: Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyse security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.   
6. Recover: The process of return affected systems back to normal operation. 

NIST S.P. 800-53: The NIST CSF also expands into the protection of the US federal gov. with NIST Special Publication which is a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government. 

## OWASP Principles

Open Web Application Security Project

Security principles: In the workplace, security principles are embedded in your daily tasks. Whether you are analyzing logs, monitoring a security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard, or using a vulnerability scanner, you will use these principles in some way. 

Previously, you were introduced to several OWASP security principles. These included:

1. Minimize attack surface area: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.  
2. Principle of least privilege: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.  
3. Defense in depth: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.  
4. Separation of duties: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege.   
5. Keep security simple: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.  
6. Fix security issues correctly: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.

Additional OWASP security principles  
Next, you’ll learn about four additional OWASP security principles that cybersecurity analysts and their teams use to keep organizational operations and people safe.

1. Establish secure defaults: This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure.   
2. Fail securely: Fail securely means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.

3. Don’t trust services: Many organizations work with third-party partners. These outside partners often have different security policies than the organization does. And the organization shouldn’t explicitly trust that their partners’ systems are secure. For example, if a third-party vendor tracks reward points for airline customers, the airline should ensure that the balance is accurate before sharing that information with their customers.

4. Avoid security by obscurity: The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016): OWASP Mobile Top 10

The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.

## Security Audits

A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. Audits are independent reviews that evaluate whether an organization is meeting internal and external criteria. Internal criteria include outlined policies, procedures, and best practices. External criteria include regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations. 

Additionally, a security audit can be used to assess an organization's established security controls. As a reminder, security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 

Audits help ensure that security checks are made (i.e., daily monitoring of security information and event management dashboards), to identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps maintain an organization’s security posture. And, if there are security issues, a remediation process must be in place.

Goals and objectives of an audit: The goal of an audit is to ensure an organization's information technology (IT) practices are meeting industry and organizational standards. The objective is to identify and address areas of remediation and growth. Audits provide direction and clarity by identifying what the current failures are and developing a plan to correct them. 

Security audits must be performed to safeguard data and avoid penalties and fines from governmental agencies. The frequency of audits is dependent on local laws and federal compliance regulations.

Factors that affect audits

* Factors that determine the types of audits an organization implements include:   
* Industry type  
* Organization size  
* Ties to the applicable government regulations  
* A business’s geographical location  
* A business decision to adhere to a specific regulatory compliance

The role of frameworks and controls in audits: Along with compliance, it’s important to mention the role of frameworks and controls in security audits. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the international standard for information security (ISO 27000\) series are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. By adhering to these and other relevant frameworks, organizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits. Additionally, frameworks, when used alongside controls, can support organizations’ ability to align with regulatory compliance requirements and standards.  

There are three main categories of controls to review during an audit, which are administrative and/or managerial, technical, and physical controls. The next heading talks about these control categories in detail. 

Audit checklist  
It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

Questions to ask in an audit:

* What is the audit meant to achieve?   
* Which assets are most at risk?   
* Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?   
* If not, what controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

Identify the scope of the audit, the audit should:

* List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.)  
* Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals  
* Indicate how often an audit should be performed  
* Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

Complete a risk assessment: A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

Conduct the audit: When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

Create a mitigation plan: A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 

Communicate results to stakeholders: The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.

* Summarize scope and goals  
* List existing risks  
* Note how quickly those risks need to be addressed  
* Identify compliance regulations  
* Provide recommendations.

## Control Categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:  
   
●      Administrative/Managerial controls  
●      Technical controls  
●      Physical controls

A controls assessment involves closely reviewing an organization's existing assets, then evaluating potential risks to those assets, to ensure internal controls and processes are effective.  
   
Administrative/Managerial controls address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls.  
   
Technical controls consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.  
   
Physical controls include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.  
Control types  
Control types include, but are not limited to:       	

1. Preventative  
2. Corrective  
3. Detective  
4. Deterrent

   
These controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect assets. Preventative controls are designed to prevent an incident from occurring in the first place. Corrective controls are used to restore an asset after an incident. Detective controls are implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress. Deterrent controls are designed to discourage attacks.  
   
Review the following charts for specific details about each type of control and its purpose.  
 

| Administrative Controls |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Control Name | Control Type | Control Purpose |
| Least Privilege | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |
| Disaster recovery plans | Corrective   | Provide business continuity |
| Password policies | Preventative | Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques |
| Access control policies | Preventative | Bolster confidentiality and integrity by defining which groups can access or modify data |
| Account management policies | Preventative | Managing account lifecycle, reducing attack surface, and limiting overall impact from disgruntled former employees and default account usage |
| Separation of duties | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |

   
   
 

| Technical Controls |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Control Name | Control Type | Control Purpose |
| Firewall   | Preventative | To filter unwanted or malicious traffic from entering the network |
| IDS/IPS | Detective | To detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule |
| Encryption   | Deterrent | Provide confidentiality to sensitive information |
| Backups | Corrective | Restore/recover from an event |
| Password management | Preventative | Reduce password fatigue |
| Antivirus (AV) software | Corrective | Detect and quarantine known threats |
| Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention | Preventative | Necessary to identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to out-of-date systems |

   
   
   
 

| Physical Controls |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Control Name | Control Type | Control Purpose |
| Time-controlled safe | Deterrent | Reduce attack surface and overall impact from physical threats |
| Adequate lighting | Deterrent | Deter threats by limiting “hiding” places |
| Closed-circuit television (CCTV) | Preventative/Detective | Closed circuit television is both a preventative and detective control because it’s presence can reduce risk of certain types of events from occurring, and can be used after an event to inform on event conditions |
| Locking cabinets (for network gear) | Preventative | Bolster integrity by preventing unauthorized personnel and other individuals from physically accessing or modifying network infrastructure gear |
| Signage indicating alarm service provider | Deterrent | Deter certain types of threats by making the likelihood of a successful attack seem low |
| Locks | Deterrent/Preventative | Bolster integrity by deterring and preventing unauthorized personnel, individuals from physically accessing assets |
| Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) | Detective/Preventative | Detect fire in physical location and prevent damage to physical assets such as inventory, servers, etc. |

 

## SIEM Dashboards

Log: A record of events that occur within an organization’s systems and networks.   
Common log sources:

1. Firewall logs: A firewall log is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network.   
2. Network logs: A network log is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.   
3. Server logs: A server log is a record of events related to services, such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests. 

Metrics are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application. 

A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools offer real-time monitoring and tracking of security event logs. The data is then used to conduct a thorough analysis of any potential security threat, risk, or vulnerability identified. SIEM tools have many dashboard options. Each dashboard option helps cybersecurity team members manage and monitor organizational data. However, currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for analysis of security events.  

The future of SIEM tools  
As cybersecurity continues to evolve, the need for cloud functionality has increased. SIEM tools have and continue to evolve to function in cloud-hosted and cloud-native environments. Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are operated by vendors who are responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure required to use the tools. Cloud-hosted tools are simply accessed through the internet and are an ideal solution for organizations that don’t want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Similar to cloud-hosted SIEM tools, cloud-native SIEM tools are also fully maintained and managed by vendors and accessed through the internet. However, cloud-native tools are designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities, such as availability, flexibility, and scalability. 

Yet, the evolution of SIEM tools is expected to continue in order to accommodate the changing nature of technology, as well as new threat actor tactics and techniques. For example, consider the current development of interconnected devices with access to the internet, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The more interconnected devices there are, the larger the cybersecurity attack surface and the amount of data that threat actors can exploit. The diversity of attacks and data that require special attention is expected to grow significantly. Additionally, as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology continues to progress, SIEM capabilities will be enhanced to better identify threat-related terminology, dashboard visualization, and data storage functionality.  

The implementation of automation will also help security teams respond faster to possible incidents, performing many actions without waiting for a human response. Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. Essentially, this means that handling common security-related incidents with the use of SIEM tools is expected to become a more streamlined process requiring less manual intervention. This frees up security analysts to handle more complex and uncommon incidents that, consequently, can’t be automated with a SOAR. Nevertheless, the expectation is for cybersecurity-related platforms to communicate and interact with one another. Although the technology allowing interconnected systems and devices to communicate with each other exists, it is still a work in progress.

## Cybersecurity and SIEM Tools:

Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data to provide security information and alerts in real-time.  
Splunk Cloud is a cloud-hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data.  
Google Chronicle is a cloud native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data.   
Open-source tools: Open-source tools are often free to use and can be user friendly. The objective of open-source tools is to provide users with software that is built by the public in a collaborative way, which can result in the software being more secure. Additionally, open-source tools allow for more customization by users, resulting in a variety of new services built from the same open-source software package.   
Software engineers create open-source projects to improve software and make it available for anyone to use, as long as the specified license is respected. The source code for open-source projects is readily available to users, as well as the training material that accompanies them. Having these sources readily available allows users to modify and improve project materials. 

Proprietary tools: Proprietary tools are developed and owned by a person or company, and users typically pay a fee for usage and training. The owners of proprietary tools are the only ones who can access and modify the source code. This means that users generally need to wait for updates to be made to the software, and at times they might need to pay a fee for those updates. Proprietary software generally allows users to modify a limited number of features to meet individual and organizational needs. Examples of proprietary tools include Splunk® and Google SecOps (Chronicle) SIEM tools.

Common misconceptions  
There is a common misconception that open-source tools are less effective and not as safe to use as proprietary tools. However, developers have been creating open-source materials for years that have become industry standards. Although it is true that threat actors have attempted to manipulate open-source tools, because these tools are open source it is actually harder for people with malicious intent to successfully cause harm. The wide exposure and immediate access to the source code by well-intentioned and informed users and professionals makes it less likely for issues to occur, because they can fix issues as soon as they’re identified.    
Examples of open-source tools  
In security, there are many tools in use that are open-source and commonly available. Two examples are Linux and Suricata.

Linux  
Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used. It allows you to tailor the operating system to your needs using a command-line interface. An operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user. It’s used to communicate with the hardware of a computer and manage software applications.   
There are multiple versions of Linux that exist to accomplish specific tasks. Linux and its command-line interface will be discussed in detail, later in the certificate program. 

Suricata  
Suricata is an open-source network analysis and threat detection software.  Network analysis and threat detection software is used to inspect network traffic to identify suspicious behavior and generate network data logs. The detection software finds activity across users, computers, or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to help uncover potential threats, risks, or vulnerabilities.   
Suricata was developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). OISF is dedicated to maintaining open-source use of the Suricata project to ensure it’s free and publicly available. Suricata is widely used in the public and private sector, and it integrates with many SIEM tools and other security tools. Suricata will also be discussed in greater detail later in the program.

Given below are more details about Splunk and Chronicle.

Splunk  
Splunk offers different SIEM tool options: Splunk® Enterprise and Splunk® Cloud. Both allow you to review an organization's data on dashboards. This helps security professionals manage an organization's internal infrastructure by collecting, searching, monitoring, and analyzing log data from multiple sources to obtain full visibility into an organization’s everyday operations. 

Review the following Splunk dashboards and their purposes:  
Security posture dashboard: The security posture dashboard is designed for security operations centers (SOCs). It displays the last 24 hours of an organization’s notable security-related events and trends and allows security professionals to determine if security infrastructure and policies are performing as designed. Security analysts can use this dashboard to monitor and investigate potential threats in real time, such as suspicious network activity originating from a specific IP address. 

Executive summary dashboard: The executive summary dashboard analyzes and monitors the overall health of the organization over time. This helps security teams improve security measures that reduce risk. Security analysts might use this dashboard to provide high-level insights to stakeholders, such as generating a summary of security incidents and trends over a specific period of time.

Incident review dashboard: The incident review dashboard allows analysts to identify suspicious patterns that can occur in the event of an incident. It assists by highlighting higher risk items that need immediate review by an analyst. This dashboard can be very helpful because it provides a visual timeline of the events leading up to an incident.

Risk analysis dashboard: The risk analysis dashboard helps analysts identify risk for each risk object (e.g., a specific user, a computer, or an IP address). It shows changes in risk-related activity or behavior, such as a user logging in outside of normal working hours or unusually high network traffic from a specific computer. A security analyst might use this dashboard to analyze the potential impact of vulnerabilities in critical assets, which helps analysts prioritize their risk mitigation efforts.

Chronicle  
Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool from Google that retains, analyzes, and searches log data to identify potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Chronicle allows you to collect and analyze log data according to: 

* A specific asset  
* A domain name  
* A user  
* An IP address

Chronicle provides multiple dashboards that help analysts monitor an organization’s logs, create filters and alerts, and track suspicious domain names. 

Review the following Chronicle dashboards and their purposes:  
Enterprise insights dashboard: The enterprise insights dashboard highlights recent alerts. It identifies suspicious domain names in logs, known as indicators of compromise (IOCs). Each result is labeled with a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of a threat. It also provides a severity level that indicates the significance of each threat to the organization. A security analyst might use this dashboard to monitor login or data access attempts related to a critical asset—like an application or system—from unusual locations or devices.

Data ingestion and health dashboard: The data ingestion and health dashboard shows the number of event logs, log sources, and success rates of data being processed into Chronicle. A security analyst might use this dashboard to ensure that log sources are correctly configured and that logs are received without error. This helps ensure that log related issues are addressed so that the security team has access to the log data they need.

IOC matches dashboard: The IOC matches dashboard indicates the top threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to the organization. Security professionals use this dashboard to observe domain names, IP addresses, and device IOCs over time in order to identify trends. This information is then used to direct the security team’s focus to the highest priority threats. For example, security analysts can use this dashboard to search for additional activity associated with an alert, such as a suspicious user login from an unusual geographic location. 

Main dashboard: The main dashboard displays a high-level summary of information related to the organization’s data ingestion, alerting, and event activity over time. Security professionals can use this dashboard to access a timeline of security events—such as a spike in failed login attempts— to identify threat trends across log sources, devices, IP addresses, and physical locations.

Rule detections dashboard: The rule detections dashboard provides statistics related to incidents with the highest occurrences, severities, and detections over time. Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all the alerts triggered by a specific detection rule, such as a rule designed to alert whenever a user opens a known malicious attachment from an email. Analysts then use those statistics to help manage recurring incidents and establish mitigation tactics to reduce an organization's level of risk.

User sign in overview dashboard: The user sign in overview dashboard provides information about user access behavior across the organization. Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all user sign-in events to identify unusual user activity, such as a user signing in from multiple locations at the same time. This information is then used to help mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to user accounts and the organization’s applications.

## Playbooks:

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.  
Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:  
A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.   
There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.  
The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

Types of playbooks  
Playbooks sometimes cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities. These might include ransomware, vishing, business email compromise (BEC), and other attacks previously discussed. Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are very common, but they are not the only types of playbooks organizations develop. 

Each organization has a different set of playbook tools, methodologies, protocols, and procedures that they adhere to, and different individuals are involved at each step of the response process, depending on the country they are in. For example, incident notification requirements from government-imposed laws and regulations, along with compliance standards, affect the content in the playbooks. These requirements are subject to change based on where the incident originated and the type of data affected. 

Incident and vulnerability response playbooks  
Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are commonly used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals. They are developed based on the goals outlined in an organization’s business continuity plan. A business continuity plan is an established path forward allowing a business to recover and continue to operate as normal, despite a disruption like a security breach.

These two types of playbooks are similar in that they both contain predefined and up-to-date lists of steps to perform when responding to an incident. Following these steps is necessary to ensure that you, as a security professional, are adhering to legal and organizational standards and protocols. These playbooks also help minimize errors and ensure that important actions are performed within a specific timeframe.

When an incident, threat, or vulnerability occurs or is identified, the level of risk to the organization depends on the potential damage to its assets. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. For this reason, a sense of urgency is essential. Following the steps outlined in playbooks is also important if any forensic task is being carried out. Mishandling data can easily compromise forensic data, rendering it unusable. 

Common steps included in incident and vulnerability playbooks include:   
Preparation  
Detection  
Analysis  
Containment  
Eradication  
Recovery from an incident 

Additional steps include performing post-incident activities, and a coordination of efforts throughout the investigation and incident and vulnerability response stages.

## SOARs, SIEMs & Playbooks:

Playbooks and SIEM tools  
Playbooks are used by cybersecurity teams in the event of an incident. Playbooks help security teams respond to incidents by ensuring that a consistent list of actions are followed in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case. Playbooks can be very detailed and may include flow charts and tables to clarify what actions to take and in which order. Playbooks are also used for recovery procedures in the event of a ransomware attack. Different types of security incidents have their own playbooks that detail who should take what action and when. 

Playbooks are generally used alongside SIEM tools. If, for example, unusual user behavior is flagged by a SIEM tool, a playbook provides analysts with instructions about how to address the issue. 

Playbooks and SOAR tools  
Playbooks are also used with SOAR tools. SOAR tools are similar to SIEM tools in that they are used for threat monitoring. SOAR is a piece of software used to automate repetitive tasks generated by tools such as a SIEM or managed detection and response (MDR). For example, if a user attempts to log into their computer too many times with the wrong password, a SOAR would automatically block their account to stop a possible intrusion. Then, analysts would refer to a playbook to take steps to resolve the issue.
