# Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity:

## Roles & Responsibilities of an entry-level cybersecurity analyst:

Security analysts are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.

1. Protection computer & Network Systems.  
2. Installing prevention software.  
3. Conducting periodic security audits.

Two sides to work on:

1. Operations: Responding to detections and doing investigations.   
2. Projects: Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections. 

Playbook: A list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents.   
Two types of skills:

1. Transferable: Skills from other areas that can apply to different careers.  
   1. Communication  
   2. Collaboration  
   3. Analysis  
   4. Problem Solving  
2. Technical: Skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures and policies.   
   1. Programming Languages  
   2. Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) tools  
   3. Computer Forensics

## The importance of cybersecurity:

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information used to infer and individual’s identity.   
Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII): Specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition. 

## Past Cybersecurity Attacks:

Computer Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. 

Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks. Primary purpose is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organisation or territory.   
Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

* Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.  
* Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.  
* Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.   
* Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Attacks in the digital age:

Social engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.   
Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

* Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.  
* Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.  
* USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.   
* Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Social engineering is incredibly effective. Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

* Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.   
* Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.   
* Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.   
* Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.   
* Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.    
* Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.  
* Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

Phishing: The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying   
malicious software.   
Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

* Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.  
* Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.  
* Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.  
* Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.  
* Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Two attacks that shaped cybersecurity industry: 

1. Loveletter attack (ILOVEYOU virus)  
2. Equifax breach  
3. Morris worm

## Introduction to the 8 CISSP security domains:

1. Security & Risk Management: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law.   
2. Asset Security: Secures digital & physical assets. It’s also related to the storage, maintenance, retention & destruction of data.   
3. Security architecture & Engineering: Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.   
4. Communication & Network security: Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.   
5. Identity & Access management: Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces and logical assets, such as networks and applications.   
6. Security assessment & Testing: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.   
7. Security operations: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.   
8. Software Development: Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.   
   

## Attack Types: 

Password attack: A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

* Brute force  
* Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

Social engineering attack: Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

* Phishing  
* Smishing  
* Vishing  
* Spear phishing  
* Whaling  
* Social media phishing  
* Business Email Compromise (BEC)  
* Watering hole attack  
* USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting  
* Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

Physical attack: A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

* Malicious USB cable  
* Malicious flash drive  
* Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

Adversarial artificial intelligence: Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

Supply-chain attack: A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

Cryptographic attack: A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

* Birthday  
* Collision  
* Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

## Threat Actor Types:

A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. The types of threat actors are:  
Advanced persistent threats: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

* Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources  
* Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

Insider threats: Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

* Sabotage  
* Corruption  
* Espionage  
* Unauthorized data access or leaks 

Hacktivists: Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

* Demonstrations  
* Propaganda  
* Social change campaigns  
* Fame

## Hacker types:

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

* Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.  
* Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.  
* Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.  
New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

* To learn and enhance their hacking skills  
* To seek revenge  
* To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.  
There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

## Security Frameworks and Controls:

Security frameworks: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.  
Purpose of security frameworks: 

1. Protecting PII  
2. Security financial information  
3. Identifying security weaknesses   
4. Managing organizational risks  
5. Aligning security with business goals

Components of security frameworks: 

1. Identify and documenting security goals  
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals  
3. Implementing security processes  
4. Monitoring and communicating results

Security controls: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 

CIA Triad: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Triad. 

1. Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.   
2. Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.   
3. Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

Asset: An item perceived as having value to an organization. 

Security Frameworks, Compliance standards and controls: 

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. 

NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) provides a process that integrates security, privacy and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \- North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC): FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC.   
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®): FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

Center for Internet Security (CIS®): CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 

1. Privacy  
2. Security   
3. Breach notification 

Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services. 

System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2): The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

* Associate  
* Supervisor  
* Manager  
* Executive  
* Vendor  
* Others 

They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA):  
 The GLBA is a U.S. law passed in 1999 that requires financial institutions to protect the privacy and security of consumers’ personal financial information. It includes rules for how companies collect, share, and safeguard data. The act has three main sections: the Financial Privacy Rule, the Safeguards Rule, and the Pretexting Provisions.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): The SOX Act was passed in 2002 to improve financial transparency and prevent corporate fraud after scandals like Enron and WorldCom. It applies mainly to publicly traded companies and enforces strict rules on financial reporting, internal controls, and data retention. It also holds executives personally accountable for the accuracy of financial statements.

United States Presidential Executive Order 14028: On May 12, 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity. Remediation efforts are directed toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to U.S. critical infrastructure.

## Ethics in Cybersecurity:

Security Ethics: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.   
Ethical Principles in Security:

1. Confidentiality: Keeping PII confidential and safe.   
2. Privacy Protections: Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.  
3. Laws: Rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.   
   

Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Confidentiality as it relates to professional ethics means that there needs to be a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.

Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. Personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) are types of personal data that can cause people harm if they are stolen. PII data is any information used to infer an individual's identity, like their name and phone number. SPII data is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines, including social security numbers and credit card numbers. To effectively safeguard PII and SPII data, security professionals hold an ethical obligation to secure private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals. 

Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. As a security professional, you will have an ethical obligation to protect your organization, its internal infrastructure, and the people involved with the organization. To do this:

* You must remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law.   
* Be transparent and just, and rely on evidence.  
* Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.   
* Stay informed and strive to advance your skills, so you can contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape.

Ethical concerns, laws and United States standpoint related to counterattacks: In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others. You can only defend. The act of counterattacking in the U.S. is perceived as an act of vigilantism. A vigilante is a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own. And because threat actors are criminals, counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm. Lastly, if the threat actor in question is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications. A hacktivist is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal. The political goal may be to promote social change or civil disobedience.   
For these reasons, the only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel.   
International standpoint on counterattacks

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

* The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.  
* The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.  
* The counterattack does not escalate the situation.  
* The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.   
To learn more about specific scenarios and ethical concerns from an international perspective, review updates provided in the Tallinn Manual online.

Ethical principles and methodologies  
Because counterattacks are generally disapproved of or illegal, the security realm has created frameworks and controls—such as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and others discussed earlier in the program—to address issues of confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws. To better understand the relationship between these issues and the ethical obligations of cybersecurity professionals, review the following key concepts as they relate to using ethics to protect organizations and the people they serve.  
As an example, consider the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is a U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information, also known as PHI, or protected health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. So, as a security professional, you might help ensure that the organization you work for adheres to both its legal and ethical obligation to inform patients of a breach if their health care data is exposed.

## Common cybersecurity tools:

Security information and event management (SIEM) tools: A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems. Depending on the amount of data you’re working with, it could take hours or days to filter through log data on your own. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  
SIEM tools provide a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze. Different SIEM tools have different dashboard types that display the information you have access to.   
SIEM tools also come with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud. Organizations may choose one hosting option over another based on a security team member’s expertise. For example, because a cloud-hosted version tends to be easier to set up, use, and maintain than an on-premise version, a less experienced security team may choose this option for their organization.

Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers): A network protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network. This means that the tool keeps a record of all the data that a computer within an organization's network encounters. Later in the program, you’ll have an opportunity to practice using some common network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) tools. 

Playbooks: A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident. Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow. Playbooks vary from one organization to the next, but they all have a similar purpose: To guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks.   
For example, consider the following scenario: You are working as a security analyst for an incident response firm. You are given a case involving a small medical practice that has suffered a security breach. Your job is to help with the forensic investigation and provide evidence to a cybersecurity insurance company. They will then use your investigative findings to determine whether the medical practice will receive their insurance payout. 

In this scenario, playbooks would outline the specific actions you need to take to conduct the investigation. Playbooks also help ensure that you are following proper protocols and procedures. When working on a forensic case, there are two playbooks you might follow:

* The first type of playbook you might consult is called the chain of custody playbook. Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. As a security analyst involved in a forensic analysis, you will work with the computer data that was breached. You and the forensic team will also need to document who, what, where, and why you have the collected evidence. The evidence is your responsibility while it is in your possession. Evidence must be kept safe and tracked. Every time evidence is moved, it should be reported. This allows all parties involved to know exactly where the evidence is at all times.  
* The second playbook your team might use is called the protecting and preserving evidence playbook. Protecting and preserving evidence is the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. As a security analyst, understanding what fragile and volatile digital evidence is, along with why there is a procedure, is critical. As you follow this playbook, you will consult the order of volatility, which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It prioritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the device in question powers off, regardless of the reason. While conducting an investigation, improper management of digital evidence can compromise and alter that evidence. When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used. For this reason, the first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data. You can preserve the data by making copies and conducting your investigation using those copies.

## Linux, Python & SQL and other cybersecurity skills:

Programming: Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Security analysts use programming languages, such as Python, to execute automation. Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. Automation also helps reduce the risk of human error.  
Another programming language used by analysts is called Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. A database is an organized collection of information or data. There can be millions of data points in a database. A data point is a specific piece of information. 

Operating systems: An operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems. They each offer different functionality and user experiences.   
Previously, you were introduced to Linux as an open-source operating system. Open source means that the code is available to the public and allows people to make contributions to improve the software. Linux is not a programming language; however, it does involve the use of a command line within the operating system. A command is an instruction telling the computer to do something. A command-line interface is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. You will learn more about Linux, including the Linux kernel and GNU, in a later course.

Web vulnerability: A web vulnerability is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.  
To stay up-to-date on the most critical risks to web applications, review the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10\.

Antivirus software: Antivirus software is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware. Depending on the type of antivirus software, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.   
Intrusion detection system 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network. The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data. Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.

Encryption: Encryption makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data. Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. Cryptographic encoding means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. Plaintext is unencrypted information and secure ciphertext is the result of encryption.    
Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representations to share information.    

Penetration testing: Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It is a thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.

# Course 2: Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

## The 8 CISSP Domains:

Domain one: Security and risk management  
All organizations must develop their security posture. Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's security posture include:

* Security goals and objectives  
* Risk mitigation processes  
* Compliance  
* Business continuity plans  
* Legal regulations  
* Professional and organizational ethics

Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

* Incident response  
* Vulnerability management  
* Application security  
* Cloud security  
* Infrastructure security

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Domain two: Asset security  
Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data. Because the loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data they hold is essential. Conducting a security impact analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset. Security analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.

Domain three: Security architecture and engineering	  
This domain focuses on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization’s assets and data. Security architects and engineers create these processes.  
One important aspect of this domain is the concept of shared responsibility. Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:

* Threat modeling  
* Least privilege  
* Defense in depth  
* Fail securely  
* Separation of duties  
* Keep it simple  
* Zero trust  
* Trust but verify

An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management (SIEM) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.

Domain four: Communication and network security  
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications.   
Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization’s networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organization’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.

Domain five: Identity and access management  
The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.  
Essentially, IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.

Domain six: Security assessment and testing   
The security assessment and testing domain focuses on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor.   
This domain suggests that organizations conduct security control testing, as well as collect and analyze data. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of conducting security audits to monitor for and reduce the probability of a data breach. To contribute to these types of tasks, cybersecurity professionals may be tasked with auditing user permissions to validate that users have the correct levels of access to internal systems.

Domain seven: Security operations   
The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. This includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:

* Training and awareness  
* Reporting and documentation  
* Intrusion detection and prevention  
* SIEM tools     
* Log management  
* Incident management  
* Playbooks  
* Post-breach forensics  
* Reflecting on lessons learned

The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amounts of data being accessed from an organization's internal network, outside of normal working hours. Once a threat is identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors.  

Domain eight: Software development security  
The software development security domain is focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications. Having secure applications helps deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.  
Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release. To achieve security, the software development process must have security in mind at each step. Security cannot be an afterthought.  
Performing application security tests can help ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated accordingly. Having a system in place to test the programming conventions, software executables, and security measures embedded in the software is necessary. Having quality assurance and pen tester professionals ensure the software has met security and performance standards is also an essential part of the software development process. For example, an entry-level analyst working for a pharmaceutical company might be asked to make sure encryption is properly configured for a new medical device that will store private patient data. 

## Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities: 

Risk management  
A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets. An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization. Assets can be digital or physical. Examples of digital assets include the personal information of employees, clients, or vendors, such as: 

* Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or unique national identification numbers assigned to individuals   
* Dates of birth  
* Bank account numbers  
* Mailing addresses

Examples of physical assets include:

* Payment kiosks  
* Servers  
* Desktop computers  
* Office spaces

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:

* Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity  
* Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether  
* Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage  
* Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk

Additionally, organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Examples of frameworks commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) and Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST).  
Following are some common types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities you’ll help organizations manage as a security professional.

Threats: A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. As an entry-level security analyst, your job is to help defend the organization’s assets from inside and outside threats. Therefore, understanding common types of threats is important to an analyst’s daily work. As a reminder, common threats include:

* Insider threats: Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.  
* Advanced persistent threats (APTs): A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

Risks: A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc. 

Risk asset types: 

* Low-risk asset: A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.  
* Medium-risk asset: A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.  
* High-risk asset: A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization’s assets, including:

* External risk: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information  
* Internal risk: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk  
* Legacy systems: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.  
* Multiparty risk: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.  
* Software compliance/licensing: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner

There are many resources, such as the NIST, that provide lists of cybersecurity risks. Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications, which is updated regularly.  
Note: The OWASP’s common attack types list contains three new risks for the years 2017 to 2021: insecure design, software and data integrity failures, and server-side request forgery. This update emphasizes the fact that security is a constantly evolving field. It also demonstrates the importance of staying up to date on current threat actor tactics and techniques, so you can be better prepared to manage these types of risks.

Vulnerabilities: A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems. Some vulnerabilities include:

* ProxyLogon: A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.  
* ZeroLogon: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.  
* Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.  
* PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.  
* Security logging and monitoring failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it  
* Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.

As an entry-level security analyst, you might work in vulnerability management, which is monitoring a system to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Although patches and updates may exist, if they are not applied, intrusions can still occur. For this reason, constant monitoring is important. The sooner an organization identifies a vulnerability and addresses it by patching it or updating their systems, the sooner it can be mitigated, reducing the organization’s exposure to the vulnerability.
