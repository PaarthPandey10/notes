# Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity:

## Roles & Responsibilities of an entry-level cybersecurity analyst:

Security analysts are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.

1. Protection computer & Network Systems.  
2. Installing prevention software.  
3. Conducting periodic security audits.

Two sides to work on:

1. Operations: Responding to detections and doing investigations.   
2. Projects: Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections. 

Playbook: A list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents.   
Two types of skills:

1. Transferable: Skills from other areas that can apply to different careers.  
   1. Communication  
   2. Collaboration  
   3. Analysis  
   4. Problem Solving  
2. Technical: Skills that require knowledge of specific tools, procedures and policies.   
   1. Programming Languages  
   2. Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) tools  
   3. Computer Forensics

## The importance of cybersecurity:

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information used to infer and individual’s identity.   
Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII): Specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition. 

## Past Cybersecurity Attacks:

Computer Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. 

Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks. Primary purpose is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organisation or territory.   
Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

* Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.  
* Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.  
* Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.   
* Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Attacks in the digital age:

Social engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.   
Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

* Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.  
* Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.  
* USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.   
* Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Social engineering is incredibly effective. Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

* Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.   
* Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.   
* Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.   
* Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.   
* Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.    
* Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.  
* Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

Phishing: The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying   
malicious software.   
Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

* Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.  
* Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.  
* Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.  
* Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.  
* Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Two attacks that shaped cybersecurity industry: 

1. Loveletter attack (ILOVEYOU virus)  
2. Equifax breach  
3. Morris worm

## Introduction to the 8 CISSP security domains:

1. Security & Risk Management: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law.   
2. Asset Security: Secures digital & physical assets. It’s also related to the storage, maintenance, retention & destruction of data.   
3. Security architecture & Engineering: Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.   
4. Communication & Network security: Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.   
5. Identity & Access management: Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces and logical assets, such as networks and applications.   
6. Security assessment & Testing: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.   
7. Security operations: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.   
8. Software Development: Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.   
   

## Attack Types: 

Password attack: A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

* Brute force  
* Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

Social engineering attack: Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

* Phishing  
* Smishing  
* Vishing  
* Spear phishing  
* Whaling  
* Social media phishing  
* Business Email Compromise (BEC)  
* Watering hole attack  
* USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting  
* Physical social engineering 

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

Physical attack: A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

* Malicious USB cable  
* Malicious flash drive  
* Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

Adversarial artificial intelligence: Adversarial artificial intelligence is a technique that manipulates artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

Supply-chain attack: A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

Cryptographic attack: A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

* Birthday  
* Collision  
* Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain. 

## Threat Actor Types:

A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. The types of threat actors are:  
Advanced persistent threats: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

* Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources  
* Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

Insider threats: Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

* Sabotage  
* Corruption  
* Espionage  
* Unauthorized data access or leaks 

Hacktivists: Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

* Demonstrations  
* Propaganda  
* Social change campaigns  
* Fame

## Hacker types:

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

* Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.  
* Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.  
* Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.  
New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

* To learn and enhance their hacking skills  
* To seek revenge  
* To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.  
There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

## Security Frameworks and Controls:

Security frameworks: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.  
Purpose of security frameworks: 

1. Protecting PII  
2. Security financial information  
3. Identifying security weaknesses   
4. Managing organizational risks  
5. Aligning security with business goals

Components of security frameworks: 

1. Identify and documenting security goals  
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals  
3. Implementing security processes  
4. Monitoring and communicating results

Security controls: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 

CIA Triad: A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Triad. 

1. Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.   
2. Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.   
3. Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

Asset: An item perceived as having value to an organization. 

Security Frameworks, Compliance standards and controls: 

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. 

NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) provides a process that integrates security, privacy and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \- North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC): FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC.   
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®): FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

Center for Internet Security (CIS®): CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 

1. Privacy  
2. Security   
3. Breach notification 

Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services. 

System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2): The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

* Associate  
* Supervisor  
* Manager  
* Executive  
* Vendor  
* Others 

They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA):  
 The GLBA is a U.S. law passed in 1999 that requires financial institutions to protect the privacy and security of consumers’ personal financial information. It includes rules for how companies collect, share, and safeguard data. The act has three main sections: the Financial Privacy Rule, the Safeguards Rule, and the Pretexting Provisions.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): The SOX Act was passed in 2002 to improve financial transparency and prevent corporate fraud after scandals like Enron and WorldCom. It applies mainly to publicly traded companies and enforces strict rules on financial reporting, internal controls, and data retention. It also holds executives personally accountable for the accuracy of financial statements.

United States Presidential Executive Order 14028: On May 12, 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity. Remediation efforts are directed toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to U.S. critical infrastructure.

## Ethics in Cybersecurity:

Security Ethics: Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.   
Ethical Principles in Security:

1. Confidentiality: Keeping PII confidential and safe.   
2. Privacy Protections: Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.  
3. Laws: Rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.   
   

Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Confidentiality as it relates to professional ethics means that there needs to be a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.

Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. Personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) are types of personal data that can cause people harm if they are stolen. PII data is any information used to infer an individual's identity, like their name and phone number. SPII data is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines, including social security numbers and credit card numbers. To effectively safeguard PII and SPII data, security professionals hold an ethical obligation to secure private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals. 

Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. As a security professional, you will have an ethical obligation to protect your organization, its internal infrastructure, and the people involved with the organization. To do this:

* You must remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law.   
* Be transparent and just, and rely on evidence.  
* Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.   
* Stay informed and strive to advance your skills, so you can contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape.

Ethical concerns, laws and United States standpoint related to counterattacks: In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others. You can only defend. The act of counterattacking in the U.S. is perceived as an act of vigilantism. A vigilante is a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own. And because threat actors are criminals, counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm. Lastly, if the threat actor in question is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications. A hacktivist is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal. The political goal may be to promote social change or civil disobedience.   
For these reasons, the only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel.   
International standpoint on counterattacks

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

* The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.  
* The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.  
* The counterattack does not escalate the situation.  
* The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.   
To learn more about specific scenarios and ethical concerns from an international perspective, review updates provided in the Tallinn Manual online.

Ethical principles and methodologies  
Because counterattacks are generally disapproved of or illegal, the security realm has created frameworks and controls—such as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and others discussed earlier in the program—to address issues of confidentiality, privacy protections, and laws. To better understand the relationship between these issues and the ethical obligations of cybersecurity professionals, review the following key concepts as they relate to using ethics to protect organizations and the people they serve.  
As an example, consider the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is a U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information, also known as PHI, or protected health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. So, as a security professional, you might help ensure that the organization you work for adheres to both its legal and ethical obligation to inform patients of a breach if their health care data is exposed.

## Common cybersecurity tools:

Security information and event management (SIEM) tools: A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems. Depending on the amount of data you’re working with, it could take hours or days to filter through log data on your own. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  
SIEM tools provide a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze. Different SIEM tools have different dashboard types that display the information you have access to.   
SIEM tools also come with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud. Organizations may choose one hosting option over another based on a security team member’s expertise. For example, because a cloud-hosted version tends to be easier to set up, use, and maintain than an on-premise version, a less experienced security team may choose this option for their organization.

Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers): A network protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network. This means that the tool keeps a record of all the data that a computer within an organization's network encounters. Later in the program, you’ll have an opportunity to practice using some common network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) tools. 

Playbooks: A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident. Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow. Playbooks vary from one organization to the next, but they all have a similar purpose: To guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks.   
For example, consider the following scenario: You are working as a security analyst for an incident response firm. You are given a case involving a small medical practice that has suffered a security breach. Your job is to help with the forensic investigation and provide evidence to a cybersecurity insurance company. They will then use your investigative findings to determine whether the medical practice will receive their insurance payout. 

In this scenario, playbooks would outline the specific actions you need to take to conduct the investigation. Playbooks also help ensure that you are following proper protocols and procedures. When working on a forensic case, there are two playbooks you might follow:

* The first type of playbook you might consult is called the chain of custody playbook. Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. As a security analyst involved in a forensic analysis, you will work with the computer data that was breached. You and the forensic team will also need to document who, what, where, and why you have the collected evidence. The evidence is your responsibility while it is in your possession. Evidence must be kept safe and tracked. Every time evidence is moved, it should be reported. This allows all parties involved to know exactly where the evidence is at all times.  
* The second playbook your team might use is called the protecting and preserving evidence playbook. Protecting and preserving evidence is the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. As a security analyst, understanding what fragile and volatile digital evidence is, along with why there is a procedure, is critical. As you follow this playbook, you will consult the order of volatility, which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It prioritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the device in question powers off, regardless of the reason. While conducting an investigation, improper management of digital evidence can compromise and alter that evidence. When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used. For this reason, the first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data. You can preserve the data by making copies and conducting your investigation using those copies.

## Linux, Python & SQL and other cybersecurity skills:

Programming: Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Security analysts use programming languages, such as Python, to execute automation. Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. Automation also helps reduce the risk of human error.  
Another programming language used by analysts is called Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. A database is an organized collection of information or data. There can be millions of data points in a database. A data point is a specific piece of information. 

Operating systems: An operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems. They each offer different functionality and user experiences.   
Previously, you were introduced to Linux as an open-source operating system. Open source means that the code is available to the public and allows people to make contributions to improve the software. Linux is not a programming language; however, it does involve the use of a command line within the operating system. A command is an instruction telling the computer to do something. A command-line interface is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. You will learn more about Linux, including the Linux kernel and GNU, in a later course.

Web vulnerability: A web vulnerability is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.  
To stay up-to-date on the most critical risks to web applications, review the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10\.

Antivirus software: Antivirus software is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware. Depending on the type of antivirus software, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.   
Intrusion detection system 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network. The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data. Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.

Encryption: Encryption makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data. Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. Cryptographic encoding means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. Plaintext is unencrypted information and secure ciphertext is the result of encryption.    
Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representations to share information.    

Penetration testing: Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It is a thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.

# Course 2: Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

## The 8 CISSP Domains:

Domain one: Security and risk management  
All organizations must develop their security posture. Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's security posture include:

* Security goals and objectives  
* Risk mitigation processes  
* Compliance  
* Business continuity plans  
* Legal regulations  
* Professional and organizational ethics

Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

* Incident response  
* Vulnerability management  
* Application security  
* Cloud security  
* Infrastructure security

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Domain two: Asset security  
Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data. Because the loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data they hold is essential. Conducting a security impact analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset. Security analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.

Domain three: Security architecture and engineering	  
This domain focuses on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization’s assets and data. Security architects and engineers create these processes.  
One important aspect of this domain is the concept of shared responsibility. Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:

* Threat modeling  
* Least privilege  
* Defense in depth  
* Fail securely  
* Separation of duties  
* Keep it simple  
* Zero trust  
* Trust but verify

An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management (SIEM) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.

Domain four: Communication and network security  
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications.   
Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization’s networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organization’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.

Domain five: Identity and access management  
The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.  
Essentially, IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.

Domain six: Security assessment and testing   
The security assessment and testing domain focuses on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor.   
This domain suggests that organizations conduct security control testing, as well as collect and analyze data. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of conducting security audits to monitor for and reduce the probability of a data breach. To contribute to these types of tasks, cybersecurity professionals may be tasked with auditing user permissions to validate that users have the correct levels of access to internal systems.

Domain seven: Security operations   
The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. This includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:

* Training and awareness  
* Reporting and documentation  
* Intrusion detection and prevention  
* SIEM tools     
* Log management  
* Incident management  
* Playbooks  
* Post-breach forensics  
* Reflecting on lessons learned

The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amounts of data being accessed from an organization's internal network, outside of normal working hours. Once a threat is identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors.  

Domain eight: Software development security  
The software development security domain is focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications. Having secure applications helps deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.  
Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release. To achieve security, the software development process must have security in mind at each step. Security cannot be an afterthought.  
Performing application security tests can help ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated accordingly. Having a system in place to test the programming conventions, software executables, and security measures embedded in the software is necessary. Having quality assurance and pen tester professionals ensure the software has met security and performance standards is also an essential part of the software development process. For example, an entry-level analyst working for a pharmaceutical company might be asked to make sure encryption is properly configured for a new medical device that will store private patient data. 

## Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities: 

Risk management  
A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets. An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization. Assets can be digital or physical. Examples of digital assets include the personal information of employees, clients, or vendors, such as: 

* Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or unique national identification numbers assigned to individuals   
* Dates of birth  
* Bank account numbers  
* Mailing addresses

Examples of physical assets include:

* Payment kiosks  
* Servers  
* Desktop computers  
* Office spaces

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:

* Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity  
* Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether  
* Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage  
* Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk

Additionally, organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Examples of frameworks commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) and Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST).  
Following are some common types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities you’ll help organizations manage as a security professional.

Threats: A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. As an entry-level security analyst, your job is to help defend the organization’s assets from inside and outside threats. Therefore, understanding common types of threats is important to an analyst’s daily work. As a reminder, common threats include:

* Insider threats: Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.  
* Advanced persistent threats (APTs): A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

Risks: A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc. 

Risk asset types: 

* Low-risk asset: A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.  
* Medium-risk asset: A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.  
* High-risk asset: A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization’s assets, including:

* External risk: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information  
* Internal risk: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk  
* Legacy systems: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.  
* Multiparty risk: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.  
* Software compliance/licensing: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner

There are many resources, such as the NIST, that provide lists of cybersecurity risks. Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications, which is updated regularly.  
Note: The OWASP’s common attack types list contains three new risks for the years 2017 to 2021: insecure design, software and data integrity failures, and server-side request forgery. This update emphasizes the fact that security is a constantly evolving field. It also demonstrates the importance of staying up to date on current threat actor tactics and techniques, so you can be better prepared to manage these types of risks.

Vulnerabilities: A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems. Some vulnerabilities include:

* ProxyLogon: A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.  
* ZeroLogon: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.  
* Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.  
* PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.  
* Security logging and monitoring failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it  
* Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.

As an entry-level security analyst, you might work in vulnerability management, which is monitoring a system to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Although patches and updates may exist, if they are not applied, intrusions can still occur. For this reason, constant monitoring is important. The sooner an organization identifies a vulnerability and addresses it by patching it or updating their systems, the sooner it can be mitigated, reducing the organization’s exposure to the vulnerability.

6. Authorize: Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organisation.   
7. Monitor: Be aware of how systems are operating. 

## More About Frameworks and Controls:

Biometrics are unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity.  
Vishing is the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Frameworks and controls  
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe. 

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someone’s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.

Specific frameworks and controls  
There are many different frameworks and controls that organizations can use to remain compliant with regulations and achieve their security goals. Frameworks covered in this reading are the Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) and the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001\. Several common security controls, used alongside these types of frameworks, are also explained. 

Cyber Threat Framework (CTF):  
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001:  
An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001\. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture. 

Controls  
Controls are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.

1. Encryption: Process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format which is unreadable to both humans and computers.   
2. Authentication: Process of verifying who someone or something is.  
3. Authorisation: Concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. 

Examples of physical controls:  
Gates, fences, and locks  
Security guards  
Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors  
Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

Examples of technical controls:  
Firewalls  
MFA  
Antivirus software

Examples of administrative controls:  
Separation of duties  
Authorization  
Asset classification

## More About the CIA Triad:

Previously, you were introduced to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and how it helps organizations consider and mitigate risk. In this reading, you will learn how cybersecurity analysts use the CIA triad in the workplace. 

The CIA triad for analysts  
The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It is made up of three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organizations work toward upholding: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful security posture, which refers to an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. 

Confidentiality: Confidentiality is the idea that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. In an organization, confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data. 

Integrity: Integrity is the idea that the data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable. Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential. One way to verify data integrity is through   
cryptography which is used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it (NIST, 2022). Another example of how an organization might implement integrity is by enabling encryption, which is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Encryption can be used to prevent access and ensure data, such as messages on an organization's internal chat platform, cannot be tampered with.  

Availability: Availability is the idea that data is accessible to those who are authorized to use it. When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used when needed. In the workplace, this could mean that the organization allows remote employees to access its internal network to perform their jobs. It’s worth noting that access to data on the internal network is still limited, depending on what type of access employees need to do their jobs. If, for example, an employee works in the organization’s accounting department, they might need access to corporate accounts but not data related to ongoing development projects.

## More About the NIST CSF:

NIST CSF: A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.   
Consists of 6 important core functions: 

1. Govern: This function emphasizes the importance of strong cybersecurity governance across all levels of the organization. It's about establishing and maintaining the structures and processes needed to effectively manage cybersecurity risk. This includes things like setting clear cybersecurity objectives, ensuring leadership commitment, developing and implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy, and continuously improving cybersecurity performance.  
2. Identify: The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization’s people and assets.  
3. Protect: The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.   
4. Detect: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.   
5. Respond: Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyse security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.   
6. Recover: The process of return affected systems back to normal operation. 

NIST S.P. 800-53: The NIST CSF also expands into the protection of the US federal gov. with NIST Special Publication which is a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government. 

## OWASP Principles:

Open Web Application Security Project

Security principles: In the workplace, security principles are embedded in your daily tasks. Whether you are analyzing logs, monitoring a security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard, or using a vulnerability scanner, you will use these principles in some way. 

Previously, you were introduced to several OWASP security principles. These included:

1. Minimize attack surface area: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.  
2. Principle of least privilege: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.  
3. Defense in depth: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.  
4. Separation of duties: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege.   
5. Keep security simple: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.  
6. Fix security issues correctly: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.

Additional OWASP security principles  
Next, you’ll learn about four additional OWASP security principles that cybersecurity analysts and their teams use to keep organizational operations and people safe.

1. Establish secure defaults: This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure.   
2. Fail securely: Fail securely means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.

3. Don’t trust services: Many organizations work with third-party partners. These outside partners often have different security policies than the organization does. And the organization shouldn’t explicitly trust that their partners’ systems are secure. For example, if a third-party vendor tracks reward points for airline customers, the airline should ensure that the balance is accurate before sharing that information with their customers.

4. Avoid security by obscurity: The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016): OWASP Mobile Top 10

The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.

## Security Audits:

A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. Audits are independent reviews that evaluate whether an organization is meeting internal and external criteria. Internal criteria include outlined policies, procedures, and best practices. External criteria include regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations. 

Additionally, a security audit can be used to assess an organization's established security controls. As a reminder, security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 

Audits help ensure that security checks are made (i.e., daily monitoring of security information and event management dashboards), to identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps maintain an organization’s security posture. And, if there are security issues, a remediation process must be in place.

Goals and objectives of an audit: The goal of an audit is to ensure an organization's information technology (IT) practices are meeting industry and organizational standards. The objective is to identify and address areas of remediation and growth. Audits provide direction and clarity by identifying what the current failures are and developing a plan to correct them. 

Security audits must be performed to safeguard data and avoid penalties and fines from governmental agencies. The frequency of audits is dependent on local laws and federal compliance regulations.

Factors that affect audits

* Factors that determine the types of audits an organization implements include:   
* Industry type  
* Organization size  
* Ties to the applicable government regulations  
* A business’s geographical location  
* A business decision to adhere to a specific regulatory compliance

The role of frameworks and controls in audits: Along with compliance, it’s important to mention the role of frameworks and controls in security audits. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the international standard for information security (ISO 27000\) series are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. By adhering to these and other relevant frameworks, organizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits. Additionally, frameworks, when used alongside controls, can support organizations’ ability to align with regulatory compliance requirements and standards.  

There are three main categories of controls to review during an audit, which are administrative and/or managerial, technical, and physical controls. The next heading talks about these control categories in detail. 

Audit checklist  
It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

Questions to ask in an audit:

* What is the audit meant to achieve?   
* Which assets are most at risk?   
* Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?   
* If not, what controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

Identify the scope of the audit, the audit should:

* List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.)  
* Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals  
* Indicate how often an audit should be performed  
* Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

Complete a risk assessment: A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

Conduct the audit: When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

Create a mitigation plan: A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 

Communicate results to stakeholders: The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.

* Summarize scope and goals  
* List existing risks  
* Note how quickly those risks need to be addressed  
* Identify compliance regulations  
* Provide recommendations.

## Control Categories:

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:  
   
●      Administrative/Managerial controls  
●      Technical controls  
●      Physical controls

A controls assessment involves closely reviewing an organization's existing assets, then evaluating potential risks to those assets, to ensure internal controls and processes are effective.  
   
Administrative/Managerial controls address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls.  
   
Technical controls consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.  
   
Physical controls include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.  
Control types  
Control types include, but are not limited to:       	

1. Preventative  
2. Corrective  
3. Detective  
4. Deterrent

   
These controls work together to provide defense in depth and protect assets. Preventative controls are designed to prevent an incident from occurring in the first place. Corrective controls are used to restore an asset after an incident. Detective controls are implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress. Deterrent controls are designed to discourage attacks.  
   
Review the following charts for specific details about each type of control and its purpose.  
 

| Administrative Controls |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Control Name | Control Type | Control Purpose |
| Least Privilege | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |
| Disaster recovery plans | Corrective   | Provide business continuity |
| Password policies | Preventative | Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques |
| Access control policies | Preventative | Bolster confidentiality and integrity by defining which groups can access or modify data |
| Account management policies | Preventative | Managing account lifecycle, reducing attack surface, and limiting overall impact from disgruntled former employees and default account usage |
| Separation of duties | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |

   
   
 

| Technical Controls |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Control Name | Control Type | Control Purpose |
| Firewall   | Preventative | To filter unwanted or malicious traffic from entering the network |
| IDS/IPS | Detective | To detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule |
| Encryption   | Deterrent | Provide confidentiality to sensitive information |
| Backups | Corrective | Restore/recover from an event |
| Password management | Preventative | Reduce password fatigue |
| Antivirus (AV) software | Corrective | Detect and quarantine known threats |
| Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention | Preventative | Necessary to identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to out-of-date systems |

   
   
   
 

| Physical Controls |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Control Name | Control Type | Control Purpose |
| Time-controlled safe | Deterrent | Reduce attack surface and overall impact from physical threats |
| Adequate lighting | Deterrent | Deter threats by limiting “hiding” places |
| Closed-circuit television (CCTV) | Preventative/Detective | Closed circuit television is both a preventative and detective control because it’s presence can reduce risk of certain types of events from occurring, and can be used after an event to inform on event conditions |
| Locking cabinets (for network gear) | Preventative | Bolster integrity by preventing unauthorized personnel and other individuals from physically accessing or modifying network infrastructure gear |
| Signage indicating alarm service provider | Deterrent | Deter certain types of threats by making the likelihood of a successful attack seem low |
| Locks | Deterrent/Preventative | Bolster integrity by deterring and preventing unauthorized personnel, individuals from physically accessing assets |
| Fire detection and prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) | Detective/Preventative | Detect fire in physical location and prevent damage to physical assets such as inventory, servers, etc. |

 

## SIEM Dashboards:

Log: A record of events that occur within an organization’s systems and networks.   
Common log sources:

1. Firewall logs: A firewall log is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network.   
2. Network logs: A network log is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.   
3. Server logs: A server log is a record of events related to services, such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests. 

Metrics are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application. 

A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools offer real-time monitoring and tracking of security event logs. The data is then used to conduct a thorough analysis of any potential security threat, risk, or vulnerability identified. SIEM tools have many dashboard options. Each dashboard option helps cybersecurity team members manage and monitor organizational data. However, currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for analysis of security events.  

The future of SIEM tools  
As cybersecurity continues to evolve, the need for cloud functionality has increased. SIEM tools have and continue to evolve to function in cloud-hosted and cloud-native environments. Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are operated by vendors who are responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure required to use the tools. Cloud-hosted tools are simply accessed through the internet and are an ideal solution for organizations that don’t want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Similar to cloud-hosted SIEM tools, cloud-native SIEM tools are also fully maintained and managed by vendors and accessed through the internet. However, cloud-native tools are designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities, such as availability, flexibility, and scalability. 

Yet, the evolution of SIEM tools is expected to continue in order to accommodate the changing nature of technology, as well as new threat actor tactics and techniques. For example, consider the current development of interconnected devices with access to the internet, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The more interconnected devices there are, the larger the cybersecurity attack surface and the amount of data that threat actors can exploit. The diversity of attacks and data that require special attention is expected to grow significantly. Additionally, as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology continues to progress, SIEM capabilities will be enhanced to better identify threat-related terminology, dashboard visualization, and data storage functionality.  

The implementation of automation will also help security teams respond faster to possible incidents, performing many actions without waiting for a human response. Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. Essentially, this means that handling common security-related incidents with the use of SIEM tools is expected to become a more streamlined process requiring less manual intervention. This frees up security analysts to handle more complex and uncommon incidents that, consequently, can’t be automated with a SOAR. Nevertheless, the expectation is for cybersecurity-related platforms to communicate and interact with one another. Although the technology allowing interconnected systems and devices to communicate with each other exists, it is still a work in progress.

## Cybersecurity and SIEM Tools:

Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data to provide security information and alerts in real-time.  
Splunk Cloud is a cloud-hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data.  
Google Chronicle is a cloud native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data.   
Open-source tools: Open-source tools are often free to use and can be user friendly. The objective of open-source tools is to provide users with software that is built by the public in a collaborative way, which can result in the software being more secure. Additionally, open-source tools allow for more customization by users, resulting in a variety of new services built from the same open-source software package.   
Software engineers create open-source projects to improve software and make it available for anyone to use, as long as the specified license is respected. The source code for open-source projects is readily available to users, as well as the training material that accompanies them. Having these sources readily available allows users to modify and improve project materials. 

Proprietary tools: Proprietary tools are developed and owned by a person or company, and users typically pay a fee for usage and training. The owners of proprietary tools are the only ones who can access and modify the source code. This means that users generally need to wait for updates to be made to the software, and at times they might need to pay a fee for those updates. Proprietary software generally allows users to modify a limited number of features to meet individual and organizational needs. Examples of proprietary tools include Splunk® and Google SecOps (Chronicle) SIEM tools.

Common misconceptions  
There is a common misconception that open-source tools are less effective and not as safe to use as proprietary tools. However, developers have been creating open-source materials for years that have become industry standards. Although it is true that threat actors have attempted to manipulate open-source tools, because these tools are open source it is actually harder for people with malicious intent to successfully cause harm. The wide exposure and immediate access to the source code by well-intentioned and informed users and professionals makes it less likely for issues to occur, because they can fix issues as soon as they’re identified.    
Examples of open-source tools  
In security, there are many tools in use that are open-source and commonly available. Two examples are Linux and Suricata.

Linux  
Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used. It allows you to tailor the operating system to your needs using a command-line interface. An operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user. It’s used to communicate with the hardware of a computer and manage software applications.   
There are multiple versions of Linux that exist to accomplish specific tasks. Linux and its command-line interface will be discussed in detail, later in the certificate program. 

Suricata  
Suricata is an open-source network analysis and threat detection software.  Network analysis and threat detection software is used to inspect network traffic to identify suspicious behavior and generate network data logs. The detection software finds activity across users, computers, or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to help uncover potential threats, risks, or vulnerabilities.   
Suricata was developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). OISF is dedicated to maintaining open-source use of the Suricata project to ensure it’s free and publicly available. Suricata is widely used in the public and private sector, and it integrates with many SIEM tools and other security tools. Suricata will also be discussed in greater detail later in the program.

Given below are more details about Splunk and Chronicle.

Splunk  
Splunk offers different SIEM tool options: Splunk® Enterprise and Splunk® Cloud. Both allow you to review an organization's data on dashboards. This helps security professionals manage an organization's internal infrastructure by collecting, searching, monitoring, and analyzing log data from multiple sources to obtain full visibility into an organization’s everyday operations. 

Review the following Splunk dashboards and their purposes:  
Security posture dashboard: The security posture dashboard is designed for security operations centers (SOCs). It displays the last 24 hours of an organization’s notable security-related events and trends and allows security professionals to determine if security infrastructure and policies are performing as designed. Security analysts can use this dashboard to monitor and investigate potential threats in real time, such as suspicious network activity originating from a specific IP address. 

Executive summary dashboard: The executive summary dashboard analyzes and monitors the overall health of the organization over time. This helps security teams improve security measures that reduce risk. Security analysts might use this dashboard to provide high-level insights to stakeholders, such as generating a summary of security incidents and trends over a specific period of time.

Incident review dashboard: The incident review dashboard allows analysts to identify suspicious patterns that can occur in the event of an incident. It assists by highlighting higher risk items that need immediate review by an analyst. This dashboard can be very helpful because it provides a visual timeline of the events leading up to an incident.

Risk analysis dashboard: The risk analysis dashboard helps analysts identify risk for each risk object (e.g., a specific user, a computer, or an IP address). It shows changes in risk-related activity or behavior, such as a user logging in outside of normal working hours or unusually high network traffic from a specific computer. A security analyst might use this dashboard to analyze the potential impact of vulnerabilities in critical assets, which helps analysts prioritize their risk mitigation efforts.

Chronicle  
Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool from Google that retains, analyzes, and searches log data to identify potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Chronicle allows you to collect and analyze log data according to: 

* A specific asset  
* A domain name  
* A user  
* An IP address

Chronicle provides multiple dashboards that help analysts monitor an organization’s logs, create filters and alerts, and track suspicious domain names. 

Review the following Chronicle dashboards and their purposes:  
Enterprise insights dashboard: The enterprise insights dashboard highlights recent alerts. It identifies suspicious domain names in logs, known as indicators of compromise (IOCs). Each result is labeled with a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of a threat. It also provides a severity level that indicates the significance of each threat to the organization. A security analyst might use this dashboard to monitor login or data access attempts related to a critical asset—like an application or system—from unusual locations or devices.

Data ingestion and health dashboard: The data ingestion and health dashboard shows the number of event logs, log sources, and success rates of data being processed into Chronicle. A security analyst might use this dashboard to ensure that log sources are correctly configured and that logs are received without error. This helps ensure that log related issues are addressed so that the security team has access to the log data they need.

IOC matches dashboard: The IOC matches dashboard indicates the top threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to the organization. Security professionals use this dashboard to observe domain names, IP addresses, and device IOCs over time in order to identify trends. This information is then used to direct the security team’s focus to the highest priority threats. For example, security analysts can use this dashboard to search for additional activity associated with an alert, such as a suspicious user login from an unusual geographic location. 

Main dashboard: The main dashboard displays a high-level summary of information related to the organization’s data ingestion, alerting, and event activity over time. Security professionals can use this dashboard to access a timeline of security events—such as a spike in failed login attempts— to identify threat trends across log sources, devices, IP addresses, and physical locations.

Rule detections dashboard: The rule detections dashboard provides statistics related to incidents with the highest occurrences, severities, and detections over time. Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all the alerts triggered by a specific detection rule, such as a rule designed to alert whenever a user opens a known malicious attachment from an email. Analysts then use those statistics to help manage recurring incidents and establish mitigation tactics to reduce an organization's level of risk.

User sign in overview dashboard: The user sign in overview dashboard provides information about user access behavior across the organization. Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all user sign-in events to identify unusual user activity, such as a user signing in from multiple locations at the same time. This information is then used to help mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to user accounts and the organization’s applications.

## Playbooks:

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

An analyst using a playbook.  
Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.  
Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:  
A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.   
There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.  
The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

Types of playbooks  
Playbooks sometimes cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities. These might include ransomware, vishing, business email compromise (BEC), and other attacks previously discussed. Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are very common, but they are not the only types of playbooks organizations develop. 

Each organization has a different set of playbook tools, methodologies, protocols, and procedures that they adhere to, and different individuals are involved at each step of the response process, depending on the country they are in. For example, incident notification requirements from government-imposed laws and regulations, along with compliance standards, affect the content in the playbooks. These requirements are subject to change based on where the incident originated and the type of data affected. 

Incident and vulnerability response playbooks  
Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are commonly used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals. They are developed based on the goals outlined in an organization’s business continuity plan. A business continuity plan is an established path forward allowing a business to recover and continue to operate as normal, despite a disruption like a security breach.

These two types of playbooks are similar in that they both contain predefined and up-to-date lists of steps to perform when responding to an incident. Following these steps is necessary to ensure that you, as a security professional, are adhering to legal and organizational standards and protocols. These playbooks also help minimize errors and ensure that important actions are performed within a specific timeframe.

When an incident, threat, or vulnerability occurs or is identified, the level of risk to the organization depends on the potential damage to its assets. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. For this reason, a sense of urgency is essential. Following the steps outlined in playbooks is also important if any forensic task is being carried out. Mishandling data can easily compromise forensic data, rendering it unusable. 

Common steps included in incident and vulnerability playbooks include:   
Preparation  
Detection  
Analysis  
Containment  
Eradication  
Recovery from an incident 

Additional steps include performing post-incident activities, and a coordination of efforts throughout the investigation and incident and vulnerability response stages.

## SOARs, SIEMs & Playbooks:

Playbooks and SIEM tools  
Playbooks are used by cybersecurity teams in the event of an incident. Playbooks help security teams respond to incidents by ensuring that a consistent list of actions are followed in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case. Playbooks can be very detailed and may include flow charts and tables to clarify what actions to take and in which order. Playbooks are also used for recovery procedures in the event of a ransomware attack. Different types of security incidents have their own playbooks that detail who should take what action and when. 

Playbooks are generally used alongside SIEM tools. If, for example, unusual user behavior is flagged by a SIEM tool, a playbook provides analysts with instructions about how to address the issue. 

Playbooks and SOAR tools  
Playbooks are also used with SOAR tools. SOAR tools are similar to SIEM tools in that they are used for threat monitoring. SOAR is a piece of software used to automate repetitive tasks generated by tools such as a SIEM or managed detection and response (MDR). For example, if a user attempts to log into their computer too many times with the wrong password, a SOAR would automatically block their account to stop a possible intrusion. Then, analysts would refer to a playbook to take steps to resolve the issue.

# Course 3: Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

## Introduction to Networks:

Network: A group of connected devices.  
Network devices: Network devices maintain information and services for users of a network. These devices connect over wired and wireless connections. After establishing a connection to the network, the devices send data packets. The data packets provide information about the source and the destination of the data.  This is how the information is sent and received via different devices on a network. 

The network is the overall infrastructure that allows devices to communicate with each other. Network devices are specialized vehicles like routers and switches that manage what is being sent and received over the network. Additionally, devices like computers and phones connect to the network via network devices. 

Note: In this diagram, a router connects to the internet through a modem, which is provided by your internet service provider (ISP). The firewall is a security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic on your network. The router then directs traffic to the devices on your home network, which can include computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, printers, and other devices. You can imagine here that the server is a file server. All devices on this network can access the files in this server. This diagram also includes a switch which is an optional device that can be used to connect more devices to your network by providing additional ports and Ethernet connections. Additionally, there are 2 routers connected to the switch here for load balancing purposes which will improve the performance of the network. 

Devices and desktop computers: Most internet users are familiar with everyday devices, such as personal computers, laptops, mobile phones, and tablets. Each device and desktop computer has a unique MAC address and IP address, which identify it on the network. They also have a network interface that sends and receives data packets. These devices can connect to the network via a hard wire or a wireless connection.

Firewalls: A firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. It is like your first line of defense. Firewalls can also restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. The organization configures the security rules of the firewall. Firewalls often reside between the secured and controlled internal network and the untrusted network resources outside the organization, such as the internet. Remember, though, firewalls are just one line of defense in the cybersecurity landscape. 

Servers: Servers provide information and services for devices like computers, smart home devices, and smartphones on the network. The devices that connect to a server are called clients. The following graphic outlines this model, which is called the client-server model. In this model, clients send requests to the server for information and services. The server performs the requests for the clients. Common examples include DNS servers that perform domain name lookups for internet sites, file servers that store and retrieve files from a database, and corporate mail servers that organize mail for a company. 

Hubs and switches: Hubs and switches both direct traffic on a local network. A hub is a device that provides a common point of connection for all devices directly connected to it. Hubs additionally repeat all information out to all ports. From a security perspective, this makes hubs vulnerable to eavesdropping. For this reason, hubs are not used as often on modern networks; most organizations use switches instead. Hubs are more commonly used for a limited network setup like a home office. 

Switches are the preferred choice for most networks. A switch forwards packets between devices directly connected to it. They analyze the destination address of each data packet and send it to the intended device. Switches maintain a MAC address table that matches MAC addresses of devices on the network to port numbers on the switch and forwards incoming data packets according to the destination MAC address. Switches are a part of the data link layer in the TCP/IP model. Overall, switches improve performance and security.

Routers: Routers connect networks and direct traffic, based on the IP address of the destination network. Routers allow devices on different networks to communicate with each other. In the TCP/IP model, routers are a part of the network layer. The IP address of the destination network is contained in the IP header. The router reads the IP header information and forwards the packet to the next router on the path to the destination. This continues until the packet reaches the destination network. Routers can also include a firewall feature that allows or blocks incoming traffic based on information in the transmission. This stops malicious traffic from entering the private network and damaging the local area network.

Modems and wireless access points: Modems usually connect your home or office with an internet service provider (ISP). ISPs provide internet connectivity via telephone lines, coaxial cables, or fiber optic cables. Modems receive transmissions or digital signals from the internet and convert them into a digital format compatible with the physical connection provided by your ISP. Usually, modems connect to a router that takes the decoded transmissions and sends them on to the local network.

Note: Enterprise networks used by large organizations to connect their users and devices often use other broadband technologies to handle high-volume traffic, instead of using a modem. 

Wireless access point: A wireless access point sends and receives digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network. Devices with wireless adapters connect to the access point using Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi refers to a set of standards that are used by network devices to communicate wirelessly. Wireless access points and the devices connected to them use Wi-Fi protocols to send data through radio waves where they are sent to routers and switches and directed along the path to their final destination.

Using network diagrams as a security analyst: Network diagrams allow network administrators and security personnel to imagine the architecture and design of their organization’s private network.  
Network diagrams are maps that show the devices on the network and how they connect. Network diagrams use small representative graphics to portray each network device and dotted lines to show how each device connects to the other. By studying network diagrams, security analysts develop and refine their strategies for securing network architectures.

Local Area Network (LAN): A local area network, or LAN, spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home.  
Wide Area Network (WAN): A wide area network or WAN spans a large geographical area like a city, state, or country.

Virtualization Tools: Virtualization tools are pieces of software that perform network operations.  
Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.  
Cloud Network: A cloud network is a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet.  
Cloud Service Providers offer:

* On-demand storage  
* Processing power  
* Analytics

## Cloud Computing and software-defined networks:

Computing processes in the cloud  
Traditional networks are called on-premise networks, which means that all of the devices used for network operations are kept at a physical location owned by the company, like in an office building, for example. Cloud computing, however, refers to the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of at a physical location owned by the company.

A cloud service provider (CSP) is a company that offers cloud computing services. These companies own large data centers in locations around the globe that house millions of servers. Data centers provide technology services, such as storage, and compute at such a large scale that they can sell their services to other companies for a fee. Companies can pay for the storage and services they need and consume them through the CSP’s application programming interface (API) or web console.

CSPs provide three main categories of services:

Software as a service (SaaS) refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.

Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.

Differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS and how each connects to a physical data center.  
Hybrid cloud environments  
When organizations use a CSP’s services in addition to their on-premise computers, networks, and storage, it is referred to as a hybrid cloud environment. When organizations use more than one CSP, it is called a multi-cloud environment. The vast majority of organizations use hybrid cloud environments to reduce costs and maintain control over network resources.

Software-defined networks  
CSPs offer networking tools similar to the physical devices that you have learned about in this section of the course. Next, you’ll review  software-defined networking in the cloud. Software-defined networks (SDNs) are made up of virtual network devices and services. Just like CSPs provide virtual computers, many SDNs also provide virtual switches, routers, firewalls, and more. Most modern network hardware devices also support network virtualization and software-defined networking. This means that physical switches and routers use software to perform packet routing. In the case of cloud networking, the SDN tools are hosted on servers located at the CSP’s data center.

Benefits of cloud computing and software-defined networks   
Three of the main reasons that cloud computing is so attractive to businesses are reliability, decreased cost, and increased scalability. 

Reliability  
Reliability in cloud computing is based on how available cloud services and resources are, how secure connections are, and how often the services are effectively running. Cloud computing allows employees and customers to access the resources they need consistently and with minimal interruption. 

Cost  
Traditionally, companies have had to provide their own network infrastructure, at least for internet connections. This meant there could be potentially significant upfront costs for companies. However, because CSPs have such large data centers, they are able to offer virtual devices and services at a fraction of the cost required for companies to install, patch, upgrade, and manage the components and software themselves.

Scalability  
Another challenge that companies face with traditional computing is scalability. When organizations experience an increase in their business needs, they might be forced to buy more equipment and software to keep up. But what if business decreases shortly after? They might no longer have the business to justify the cost incurred by the upgraded components. CSPs reduce this risk by making it easy to consume services in an elastic utility model as needed. This means that companies only pay for what they need when they need it. 

Changes can be made quickly through the CSPs, APIs, or web console—much more quickly than if network technicians had to purchase their own hardware and set it up. For example, if a company needs to protect against a threat to their network, web application firewalls (WAFs), intrusion detection/protection systems (IDS/IPS), or L3/L4 firewalls can be configured quickly whenever necessary, leading to better network performance and security.

## TCP/IP Model:

Port: Within the operating system of a network device, a port is a software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.

The TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. This model helps network engineers and network security analysts conceptualize processes on the network and communicate where disruptions or security threats occur. 

The TCP/IP model has four layers: the network access layer, internet layer, transport layer, and application layer. When troubleshooting issues on the network, security professionals can analyze which layers were impacted by an attack based on what processes were involved in an incident. 

The four layers of the TCP/IP model labeled application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and network access layer  
Network access layer   
The network access layer, sometimes called the data link layer, deals with the creation of data packets and their transmission across a network. This layer corresponds to the physical hardware involved in network transmission. Hubs, modems, cables, and wiring are all considered part of this layer. The address resolution protocol (ARP) is part of the network access layer. Since MAC addresses are used to identify hosts on the same physical network, ARP is needed to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication.

Internet layer  
The internet layer, sometimes referred to as the network layer, is responsible for ensuring the delivery to the destination host, which potentially resides on a different network. It ensures IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver. The internet layer also determines which protocol is responsible for delivering the data packets and ensures the delivery to the destination host. Here are some of the common protocols that operate at the internet layer:

Internet Protocol (IP). IP sends the data packets to the correct destination and relies on the Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) to deliver them to the corresponding service. IP packets allow communication between two networks. They are routed from the sending network to the receiving network. TCP in particular retransmits any data that is lost or corrupt.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). The ICMP shares error information and status updates of data packets. This is useful for detecting and troubleshooting network errors. The ICMP reports information about packets that were dropped or that disappeared in transit, issues with network connectivity, and packets redirected to other routers.

Transport layer  
The transport layer is responsible for delivering data between two systems or networks and includes protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network. TCP and UDP are the two transport protocols that occur at this layer. 

Transmission Control Protocol   
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. It ensures that data is reliably transmitted to the destination service. TCP contains the port number of the intended destination service, which resides in the TCP header of a TCP/IP packet.

User Datagram Protocol   
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before transmissions. It is used by applications that are not concerned with the reliability of the transmission. Data sent over UDP is not tracked as extensively as data sent using TCP. Because UDP does not establish network connections, it is used mostly for performance sensitive applications that operate in real time, such as video streaming.

Application layer  
The application layer in the TCP/IP model is similar to the application, presentation, and session layers of the OSI model. The application layer is responsible for making network requests or responding to requests. This layer defines which internet services and applications any user can access. Protocols in the application layer determine how the data packets will interact with receiving devices. Some common protocols used on this layer are: 

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)  
Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)  
Secure shell (SSH)  
File transfer protocol (FTP)  
Domain name system (DNS)  
Application layer protocols rely on underlying layers to transfer the data across the network.

TCP/IP model versus OSI model  
The TCP/IP model next to the OSI model  
The OSI visually organizes network protocols into different layers. Network professionals often use this model to communicate with each other about potential sources of problems or security threats when they occur. 

The TCP/IP model combines multiple layers of the OSI model. There are many similarities between the two models. Both models define standards for networking and divide the network communication process into different layers. The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model.

## The OSI Model:

The TCP/IP model vs. the OSI model  
The TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. This model helps network engineers and security analysts conceptualize processes on the network and communicate where disruptions or security threats occur.

The TCP/IP model has four layers: the network access layer, internet layer, transport layer, and application layer. When analyzing network events, security professionals can determine what layer or layers an attack occurred in based on what processes were involved in the incident. 

The OSI model is a standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network. Network and security professionals often use this model to communicate with each other about potential sources of problems or security threats when they occur.

The seven layers of the OSI model labeled application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical  
Some organizations rely heavily on the TCP/IP model, while others prefer to use the OSI model. As a security analyst, it’s important to be familiar with both models. Both the TCP/IP and OSI models are useful for understanding how networks work. 

Layer 7: Application layer  
The application layer includes processes that directly involve the everyday user. This layer includes all of the networking protocols that software applications use to connect a user to the internet. This characteristic is the identifying feature of the application layer—user connection to the internet via applications and requests.

An example of a type of communication that happens at the application layer is using a web browser. The internet browser uses HTTP or HTTPS to send and receive information from the website server. The email application uses simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) to send and receive email information. Also, web browsers use the domain name system (DNS) protocol to translate website domain names into IP addresses which identify the web server that hosts the information for the website. 

Layer 6: Presentation layer  
Functions at the presentation layer involve data translation and encryption for the network. This layer adds to and replaces data with formats that can be understood by applications (layer 7\) on both sending and receiving systems. Formats at the user end may be different from those of the receiving system. Processes at the presentation layer require the use of a standardized format.

Some formatting functions that occur at layer 6 include encryption, compression, and confirmation that the character code set can be interpreted on the receiving system. One example of encryption that takes place at this layer is SSL, which encrypts data between web servers and browsers as part of websites with HTTPS.

Layer 5: Session layer  
A session describes when a connection is established between two devices. An open session allows the devices to communicate with each other. Session layer protocols keep the session open while data is being transferred and terminate the session once the transmission is complete. 

The session layer is also responsible for activities such as authentication, reconnection, and setting checkpoints during a data transfer. If a session is interrupted, checkpoints ensure that the transmission picks up at the last session checkpoint when the connection resumes. Sessions include a request and response between applications. Functions in the session layer respond to requests for service from processes in the presentation layer (layer 6\) and send requests for services to the transport layer (layer 4).

Layer 4: Transport layer  
The transport layer is responsible for delivering data between devices. This layer also handles the speed of data transfer, flow of the transfer, and breaking data down into smaller segments to make them easier to transport. Segmentation is the process of dividing up a large data transmission into smaller pieces that can be processed by the receiving system. These segments need to be reassembled at their destination so they can be processed at the session layer (layer 5). The speed and rate of the transmission also has to match the connection speed of the destination system. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols. 

Layer 3: Network layer  
The network layer oversees receiving the frames from the data link layer (layer 2\) and delivers them to the intended destination. The intended destination can be found based on the address that resides in the frame of the data packets. Data packets allow communication between two networks. These packets include IP addresses that tell routers where to send them. They are routed from the sending network to the receiving network. 

Layer 2: Data link layer  
The data link layer organizes sending and receiving data packets within a single network. The data link layer is home to switches on the local network and network interface cards on local devices.

Protocols like network control protocol (NCP), high-level data link control (HDLC), and synchronous data link control protocol (SDLC) are used at the data link layer.

Layer 1: Physical layer   
As the name suggests, the physical layer corresponds to the physical hardware involved in network transmission. Hubs, modems, and the cables and wiring that connect them are all considered part of the physical layer. To travel across an ethernet or coaxial cable, a data packet needs to be translated into a stream of 0s and 1s. The stream of 0s and 1s are sent across the physical wiring and cables, received, and then passed on to higher levels of the OSI model.

## Components of network layer communication:

Operations at the network layer  
Functions at the network layer organize the addressing and delivery of data packets across the network from the host device to the destination device. This includes directing the packets from one router to another router across the internet, till it reaches the internet protocol (IP) address of the destination network. The destination IP address is contained within the header of each data packet. This address will be stored for future routing purposes in  routing tables along the packet’s path to its destination.

All data packets include an IP address. A data packet is also referred to as an IP packet for TCP connections or a datagram for UDP connections. A router uses the IP address to route packets from network to network based on information contained in the IP header of a data packet. Header information communicates more than just the address of the destination. It also includes information such as the source IP address, the size of the packet, and which protocol will be used for the data portion of the packet. 

Format of an IPv4 packet  
An IP packet divided into two parts: a section on the left marked “header,” and section on the right marked “data”  
Next, you can review the format of an IP version 4 (IPv4) packet and review a detailed graphic of the packet header. An IPv4 packet is made up of two sections, the header and the data:

An IPv4 header format is determined by the IPv4 protocol and includes the IP routing information that devices use to direct the packet. The size of the IPv4 header ranges from 20 to 60 bytes. The first 20 bytes are a fixed set of information containing data such as the source and destination IP address, header length, and total length of the packet. The last set of bytes can range from 0 to 40 and consists of the options field.

The length of the data section of an IPv4 packet can vary greatly in size. However, the maximum possible size of an IPv4 packet is 65,535 bytes. It contains the message being transferred over the internet, like website information or email text. 

Diagram of an IPv4 packet header, 13 fields, and bit size  
There are 13 fields within the header of an IPv4 packet:

Version (VER): This 4 bit component tells receiving devices what protocol the packet is using. The packet used in the illustration above is an IPv4 packet.

IP Header Length (HLEN or IHL): HLEN is the packet’s header length. This value indicates where the packet header ends and the data segment begins. 

Type of Service (ToS): Routers prioritize packets for delivery to maintain quality of service on the network. The ToS field provides the router with this information.

Total Length: This field communicates the total length of the entire IP packet, including the header and data. The maximum size of an IPv4 packet is 65,535 bytes.

Identification: IPv4 packets can be up to 65, 535 bytes, but most networks have a smaller limit. In these cases, the packets are divided, or fragmented, into smaller IP packets. The identification field provides a unique identifier for all the fragments of the original IP packet so that they can be reassembled once they reach their destination.

Flags: This field provides the routing device with more information about whether the original packet has been fragmented and if there are more fragments in transit.

Fragmentation Offset: The fragment offset field tells routing devices where in the original packet the fragment belongs.

Time to Live (TTL): TTL prevents data packets from being forwarded by routers indefinitely. It contains a counter that is set by the source. The counter is decremented by one as it passes through each router along its path. When the TTL counter reaches zero, the router currently holding the packet will discard the packet and return an ICMP Time Exceeded error message to the sender. 

Protocol: The protocol field tells the receiving device which protocol will be used for the data portion of the packet.

Header Checksum: The header checksum field contains a checksum that can be used to detect corruption of the IP header in transit. Corrupted packets are discarded.

Source IP Address: The source IP address is the IPv4 address of the sending device.

Destination IP Address: The destination IP address is the IPv4 address of the destination device.

Options: The options field allows for security options to be applied to the packet if the HLEN value is greater than five. The field communicates these options to the routing devices.

Difference between IPv4 and IPv6  
In an earlier part of this course, you learned about the history of IP addressing. As the internet grew, it became clear that all of the IPv4 addresses would eventually be depleted; this is called IPv4 address exhaustion. At the time, no one had anticipated how many computing devices would need an IP address. IPv6 was developed to mitigate IPv4 address exhaustion and other related concerns. 

Some of the key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 include the length and the format of the addresses. IPv4 addresses are made up of four decimal numbers separated by periods, each number ranging from 0 to 255\. Together the numbers span 4 bytes, and allow for up to 4.3 billion possible addresses. An example of an IPv4 address would be: 198.51.100.0. IPv6 addresses are made of eight hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, each number consisting of up to four hexadecimal digits. Together, all numbers span 16 bytes, and allow for up to 340 undecillion addresses (340 followed by 36 zeros). An example of an IPv6 address would be: 2002:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff21:0023:1234.

Note: to represent one or more consecutive sets of all zeros, you can replace the zeros with a double colon "::", so the above IPv6 address would be "2002:0db8::ff21:0023:1234."

There are also some differences in the layout of an IPv6 packet header. The IPv6 header format is much simpler than IPv4. For example, the IPv4 Header includes the IHL, Identification, and Flags fields, whereas the IPv6 does not. The IPv6 header only introduces the Flow Label field, where the Flow Label identifies a packet as requiring special handling by other IPv6 routers. 

Side by side diagrams of an IPv4 packet header and a simplified IPv6 packet  
There are some important security differences between IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 offers more efficient routing and eliminates private address collisions that can occur on IPv4 when two devices on the same network are attempting to use the same address.

## Common Network Protocols:

Overview of network protocols  
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware. You’ll learn more about this topic in upcoming course materials. 

Three categories of network protocols  
Network protocols can be divided into three main categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security protocols. There are dozens of different network protocols, but you don’t need to memorize all of them for an entry-level security analyst role. However, it’s important for you to know the ones listed in this reading. 

Communication protocols  
Communication protocols govern the exchange of information in network transmission. They dictate how the data is transmitted between devices and the timing of the communication. They also include methods to recover data lost in transit. Here are a few of them.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. TCP uses a three-way handshake process. First, the device sends a synchronize (SYN) request to a server. Then the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge receipt of the device's request. Once the server receives the final ACK packet from the device, a TCP connection is established. In the TCP/IP model, TCP occurs at the transport layer.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. This makes it less reliable than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for sending DNS requests to local DNS servers. In the TCP/IP model, UDP occurs at the transport layer.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that provides a method of communication between clients and website servers. HTTP uses port 80\. HTTP is considered insecure, so it is being replaced on most websites by a secure version, called HTTPS that uses encryption from SSL/TLS for communication. However, there are still many websites that use the insecure HTTP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, HTTP occurs at the application layer.

Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that translates internet domain names into IP addresses. When a client computer wishes to access a website domain using their internet browser, a query is sent to a dedicated DNS server. The DNS server then looks up the IP address that corresponds to the website domain. DNS normally uses UDP on port 53\. However, if the DNS reply to a request is large, it will switch to using the TCP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, DNS occurs at the application layer.

Management Protocols  
The next category of network protocols is management protocols. Management protocols are used for monitoring and managing activity on a network. They include protocols for error reporting and optimizing performance on the network.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network. SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. It can also send requests to network devices for a report on how much of the network’s bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the application layer.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network. ICMP is used by a receiving device to send a report to the sending device about the data transmission. ICMP is commonly used as a quick way to troubleshoot network connectivity and latency by issuing the “ping” command on a Linux operating system. In the TCP/IP model, ICMP occurs at the internet layer.

Security Protocols  
Security protocols are network protocols that ensure that data is sent and received securely across a network. Security protocols use encryption algorithms to protect data in transit. Below are some common security protocols.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) encryption on all transmissions so that malicious actors cannot read the information contained. HTTPS uses port 443\. In the TCP/IP model, HTTPS occurs at the application layer.

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure protocol used to transfer files from one device to another over a network. SFTP uses secure shell (SSH), typically through TCP port 22\. SSH uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the application layer. SFTP is used often with cloud storage. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.

Note: The encryption protocols mentioned do not conceal the source or destination IP address of network traffic. This means a malicious actor can still learn some basic information about the network traffic if they intercept it.

Network Address Translation  
The devices on your local home or office network each have a private IP address that they use to communicate directly with each other. However, in order for the devices with private IP addresses to communicate with the public internet, they need to have a single public IP address that represents all devices on the LAN to the public. For outgoing messages, the router can replace a private source IP address with its public IP address and perform the reverse operation for responses. This process is known as Network Address Translation (NAT) and it generally requires a router or firewall to be specifically configured to perform NAT. NAT is a part of layer 2 (internet layer) and layer 3 (transport layer) of the TCP/IP model.

|  Private IP Addresses | Public IP Addresses |
| :---- | :---- |
| Assigned by the router Unique only within private network No cost to use Address ranges: 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 | Assigned by ISP and IANA Unique address in global internet Costs to lease a public IP address Assignable address ranges: 1.0.0.0-9.255.255.255 11.0.0.0-126.255.255.255 128.0.0.0-172.15.255.255 172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255 192.169.0.0-233.255.255.255 |

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is in the management family of network protocols. DHCP is an application layer protocol used on a network to configure devices. It works with the router to assign a unique IP address to each device and provide the addresses of the appropriate DNS server and default gateway for each device. DHCP servers operate on UDP port 67 while DHCP clients operate on UDP port 68\.

Address Resolution Protocol  
By now, you are familiar with IP and MAC addresses. You’ve learned that each device on a network has a public IP address, a private IP address, and a MAC address that identify it on the network. A device’s IP address may change over time, but its MAC address is permanent because it is unique to a device's network interface card. The MAC address is used to communicate with devices within the same network, but sometimes, the MAC address is unknown. This is why the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is needed. ARP is mainly a network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model used to translate the IP addresses that are found in data packets into the MAC address of the hardware device.   
Each device on the network performs ARP and keeps track of matching IP and MAC addresses in an ARP cache. ARP does not have a specific port number since it is a layer 2 protocol and port numbers are associated with the layer 7 application layer.

Telnet   
Telnet is an application layer protocol that is used to connect with a remote system. Telnet sends all information in clear text. It uses command line prompts to control another device similar to secure shell (SSH), but Telnet is not as secure as SSH. Telnet can be used to connect to local or remote devices and uses TCP port 23\. 

Secure shell  
Secure shell protocol (SSH) is used to create a secure connection with a remote system. This application layer protocol provides an alternative for secure authentication and encrypted communication. SSH operates over the TCP port 22 and is a replacement for less secure protocols, such as Telnet.

Post office protocol  
Post office protocol (POP) is an application layer (layer 4 of the TCP/IP model) protocol used to manage and retrieve email from a mail server. POP3 is the most commonly used version of POP. Many organizations have a dedicated mail server on the network that handles incoming and outgoing mail for users on the network. User devices will send requests to the remote mail server and download email messages locally. If you have ever refreshed your email application and had new emails populate in your inbox, you are experiencing POP and internet message access protocol (IMAP) in action. Unencrypted, plaintext authentication uses TCP/UDP port 110 and encrypted emails use Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) over TCP/UDP port 995\.  When using POP, mail has to finish downloading on a local device before it can be read. After downloading, the mail may or may not be deleted from the mail server, so it does not guarantee that a user can sync the same email across multiple devices. 

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)  
IMAP is used for incoming email. It downloads the headers of emails and the message content. The content also remains on the email server, which allows users to access their email from multiple devices. IMAP uses TCP port 143 for unencrypted email and TCP port 993 over the TLS protocol. Using IMAP allows users to partially read email before it is finished downloading. Since the mail is kept on the mail server, it allows a user to sync emails across multiple devices.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transmit and route email from the sender to the recipient’s address. SMTP works with Message Transfer Agent (MTA) software, which searches DNS servers to resolve email addresses to IP addresses, to ensure emails reach their intended destination. SMTP uses TCP/UDP port 25 for unencrypted emails and TCP/UDP port 587 using TLS for encrypted emails. The TCP port 25 is often used by high-volume spam. SMTP helps to filter out spam by regulating how many emails a source can send at a time.

Protocols and port numbers  
Remember that port numbers are used by network devices to determine what should be done with the information contained in each data packet once they reach their destination. Firewalls can filter out unwanted traffic based on port numbers. For example, an organization may configure a firewall to only allow access to TCP port 995 (POP3) by IP addresses belonging to the organization.  
As a security analyst, you will need to know about many of the protocols and port numbers mentioned in this course. They may be used to determine your technical knowledge in interviews, so it’s a good idea to memorize them. You will also learn about new protocols on the job in a security position.

|  Protocol | Port |
| :---- | :---- |
| DHCP | UDP port 67 (servers) UDP port 68 (clients) |
| ARP | none |
| Telnet | TCP port 23 |
| SSH | TCP port 22 |
| POP3 | TCP/UDP port 110 (unencrypted) TCP/UDP port 995 (encrypted, SSL/TLS) |
| IMAP | TCP port 143 (unencrypted) TCP port 993 (encrypted, SSL/TLS) |
| SMTP | TCP/UDP Port 25 (unencrypted) |
| SMTPS | TCP/UDP port 587 (encrypted, TLS) |

## Wireless Security Protocols:

In the early days of the internet, all internet communication happened across physical cables. It wasn’t until the mid-1980s that authorities in the United States designated a spectrum of radio wave frequencies that could be used without a license, so there was more opportunity for the internet to expand. 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, technologies were developed to send and receive data over radio. Today, users access wireless internet through laptops, smart phones, tablets, and desktops. Smart devices, like thermostats, door locks, and security cameras, also use wireless internet to communicate with each other and with services on the internet.

Wireless router with antenna connected to WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 protocols  
Introduction to wireless communication protocols  
Many people today refer to wireless internet as Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi refers to a set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs. Wi-Fi is a marketing term commissioned by the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA). WECA has since renamed their organization Wi-Fi Alliance. 

Wi-Fi standards and protocols are based on the 802.11 family of internet communication standards determined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). So, as a security analyst, you might also see Wi-Fi referred to as IEEE 802.11.

Wi-Fi communications are secured by wireless networking protocols. Wireless security protocols have evolved over the years, helping to identify and resolve vulnerabilities with more advanced wireless technologies.

In this reading, you will learn about the evolution of wireless security protocols from WEP to WPA, WPA2, and WPA3. You’ll also learn how the Wireless Application Protocol was used for mobile internet communications.

Wired Equivalent Privacy  
Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is a wireless security protocol designed to provide users with the same level of privacy on wireless network connections as they have on wired network connections. WEP was developed in 1999 and is the oldest of the wireless security standards.

WEP is largely out of use today, but security analysts should still understand WEP in case they encounter it. For example, a network router might have used WEP as the default security protocol and the network administrator never changed it. Or, devices on a network might be too old to support newer Wi-Fi security protocols. Nevertheless, a malicious actor could potentially break the WEP encryption, so it’s now considered a high-risk security protocol.

Wi-Fi Protected Access  
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was developed in 2003 to improve upon WEP, address the security issues that it presented, and replace it. WPA was always intended to be a transitional measure so backwards compatibility could be established with older hardware.

The flaws with WEP were in the protocol itself and how the encryption was used. WPA addressed this weakness by using a protocol called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). WPA encryption algorithm uses larger secret keys than WEPs, making it more difficult to guess the key by trial and error.

WPA also includes a message integrity check that includes a message authentication tag with each transmission. If a malicious actor attempts to alter the transmission in any way or resend at another time, WPA’s message integrity check will identify the attack and reject the transmission.

Despite the security improvements of WPA, it still has vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can use a key reinstallation attack (or KRACK attack) to decrypt transmissions using WPA. Attackers can insert themselves in the WPA authentication handshake process and insert a new encryption key instead of the dynamic one assigned by WPA. If they set the new key to all zeros, it is as if the transmission is not encrypted at all.

Because of this significant vulnerability, WPA was replaced with an updated version of the protocol called WPA2. 

WPA2 & WPA3  
WPA2  
The second version of Wi-Fi Protected Access—known as WPA2—was released in 2004\. WPA2 improves upon WPA by using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). WPA2 also improves upon WPA’s use of TKIP. WPA2 uses the Counter Mode Cipher Block Chain Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP), which provides encapsulation and ensures message authentication and integrity. Because of the strength of WPA2, it is considered the security standard for all Wi-Fi transmissions today. WPA2, like its predecessor, is vulnerable to KRACK attacks. This led to the development of WPA3 in 2018\. 

Personal  
WPA2 personal mode is best suited for home networks for a variety of reasons. It is easy to implement, initial setup takes less time for personal than enterprise version. The global passphrase for WPA2 personal version needs to be applied to each individual computer and access point in a network. This makes it ideal for home networks, but unmanageable for organizations. 

Enterprise  
WPA2 enterprise mode works best for business applications. It provides the necessary security for wireless networks in business settings. The initial setup is more complicated than WPA2 personal mode, but enterprise mode offers individualized and centralized control over the Wi-Fi access to a business network. This means that network administrators can grant or remove user access to a network at any time. Users never have access to encryption keys, this prevents potential attackers from recovering network keys on individual computers.

WPA3  
WPA3 is a secure Wi-Fi protocol and is growing in usage as more WPA3 compatible devices are released. These are the key differences between WPA2 and WPA3:

WPA3 addresses the authentication handshake vulnerability to KRACK attacks, which is present in WPA2. 

WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), a password-authenticated, cipher-key-sharing agreement. This prevents attackers from downloading data from wireless network connections to their systems to attempt to decode it.

WPA3 has increased encryption to make passwords more secure  by using 128-bit encryption, with WPA3-Enterprise mode offering optional 192-bit encryption.

## Firewalls and VPNs:

Firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network. 

1. Hardware firewall  
2. Software firewall  
3. Cloud firewall

Cloud-based firewalls are software firewalls hosted by a cloud service provider. 

* Stateful refers to a class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats.   
* Stateless refers to a class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and does not keep track of information from data packets.

Next Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)

* Deep packet inspection  
* Intrusion protection  
* Threat intelligence

Virtual Private Network (VPN): A virtual private network, also known as a VPN, is a network security service that changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you're using a public network like the internet.

Security Zones: Security zones are a segment of a network that protects the internal network from the internet.  
Network Segmentation: Security Zones are a part of a security technique called network segmentation that divides the network into segments.

1. Uncontrolled Zone: Any network outside of the organization’s control like the internet.   
2. Controlled Zone: A subnet that protects the internal network from the uncontrolled zone.   
   1. Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)  
   2. Internal Network  
   3. Restricted Zone

## Subnetting and CIDR:

Earlier in this course, you learned about network segmentation, a security technique that divides networks into sections. A private network can be segmented to protect portions of the network from the internet, which is an unsecured global network. 

For example, you learned about the uncontrolled zone, the controlled zone, the demilitarized zone, and the restricted zone. Feel free to review the video about   
security zones  
 for a refresher on how network segmentation can be used to add a layer of security to your organization’s network operations. Creating security zones is one example of a networking strategy called subnetting.

Overview of subnetting  
Subnetting is the subdivision of a network into logical groups called subnets. It works like a network inside a network. Subnetting divides up a network address range into smaller subnets within the network. These smaller subnets form based on the IP addresses and network mask of the devices on the network. Subnetting creates a network of devices to function as their own network. This makes the network more efficient and can also be used to create security zones. If devices on the same subnet communicate with each other, the switch changes the transmissions to stay on the same subnet, improving speed and efficiency of the communications.

Two subnets for two networks connected to one router.  
Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation for subnetting  
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method of assigning subnet masks to IP addresses to create a subnet. Classless addressing replaces classful addressing. Classful addressing was used in the 1980s as a system of grouping IP addresses into classes (Class A to Class E). Each class included a limited number of IP addresses, which were depleted as the number of devices connecting to the internet outgrew the classful range in the 1990s. Classless CIDR addressing expanded the number of available IPv4 addresses. 

CIDR allows cybersecurity professionals to segment classful networks into smaller chunks. CIDR IP addresses are formatted like IPv4 addresses, but they include a slash (“/’”) followed by a number at the end of the address, This extra number is called the IP network prefix.  For example, a regular IPv4 address uses the 198.51.100.0 format, whereas a CIDR IP address would include the IP network prefix at the end of the address, 198.51.100.0/24. This CIDR address encompasses all IP addresses between 198.51.100.0 and 198.51.100.255. The system of CIDR addressing reduces the number of entries in routing tables and provides more available IP addresses within networks. You can try converting CIDR to IPv4 addresses and vice versa through an online conversion tool, like   
IPAddressGuide  
, for practice and to better understand this concept.

Note: You may learn more about CIDR during your career, but it won't be covered in any additional depth in this certificate program. For now, you only need a basic understanding of this concept.

Security benefits of subnetting  
Subnetting allows network professionals and analysts to create a network within their own network without requesting another network IP address from their internet service provider. This process uses network bandwidth more efficiently and improves network performance. Subnetting is one component of creating isolated subnetworks through physical isolation, routing configuration, and firewalls.

## Virtual Networks and Privacy:

Common network protocols    
Network protocols are used to direct traffic to the correct device and service depending on the kind of communication being performed by the devices on the network. Protocols are the rules used by all network devices that provide a mutually agreed upon foundation for how to transfer data across a network.

There are three main categories of network protocols: communication protocols, management protocols, and security protocols. 

Communication protocols are used to establish connections between servers. Examples include TCP, UDP, and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which provides a framework for email communication. 

Management protocols are used to troubleshoot network issues. One example is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).

Security protocols provide encryption for data in transit. Examples include IPSec and SSL/TLS.

Some other commonly used protocols are:

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is an application layer communication protocol. This allows the browser and the web server to communicate with one another. 

Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is an application layer protocol that translates, or maps, host names to IP addresses.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). ARP is a network layer communication protocol that maps IP addresses to physical machines or a MAC address recognized on the local area network.

Wi-Fi  
This section of the course also introduced various wireless security protocols, including WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3. WPA3 encrypts traffic with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher as it travels from your device to the wireless access point. WPA2 and WPA3 offer two modes: personal and enterprise. Personal mode is best suited for home networks while enterprise mode is generally utilized for business networks and applications.

Network security tools and practices    
Firewalls   
Previously, you learned that firewalls are network virtual appliances (NVAs) or hardware devices that inspect and can filter network traffic before it’s permitted to enter the private network. Traditional firewalls are configured with rules that tell it what types of data packets are allowed based on the port number and IP address of the data packet. 

Three types of firewalls are:

* Hardware  
* Software  
* Cloud-based

There are two main categories of firewalls.

Stateless: A class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and does not keep track of information from data packets

Stateful: A class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats. Unlike stateless firewalls, which require rules to be configured in two directions, a stateful firewall only requires a rule in one direction. This is because it uses a "state table" to track connections, so it can match return traffic to an existing session 

Next generation firewalls (NGFWs) are the most technologically advanced firewall protection. They exceed the security offered by stateful firewalls because they include deep packet inspection (a kind of packet sniffing that examines data packets and takes actions if threats exist) and intrusion prevention features that detect security threats and notify firewall administrators. NGFWs can inspect traffic at the application layer of the TCP/IP model and are typically application aware. Unlike traditional firewalls that block traffic based on IP address and ports, NGFWs rules can be configured to block or allow traffic based on the application. Some NGFWs have additional features like Malware Sandboxing, Network Anti-Virus, and URL and DNS Filtering.  

Proxy servers   
A proxy server is another way to add security to your private network. Proxy servers utilize network address translation (NAT) to serve as a barrier between clients on the network and external threats. Forward proxies handle queries from internal clients when they access resources external to the network. Reverse proxies function opposite of forward proxies; they handle requests from external systems to services on the internal network. Some proxy servers can also be configured with rules, like a firewall.  For example, you can create filters to block websites identified as containing malware.

Virtual Private Networks (VPN)  
A VPN is a service that encrypts data in transit and disguises your IP address. VPNs use a process called encapsulation. Encapsulation wraps your unencrypted data in an encrypted data packet, which allows your data to be sent across the public network while remaining anonymous. Enterprises and other organizations use VPNs to help protect communications from users’ devices to corporate resources. Some of these resources include servers or virtual machines that host business applications. Individuals also use VPNs to increase personal privacy. VPNs protect user privacy by concealing personal information, including IP addresses, from external servers. A reputable VPN also minimizes its own access to user internet activity by using strong encryption and other security measures. Organizations are increasingly using a combination of VPN and SD-WAN capabilities to secure their networks. A software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) is a virtual WAN service that allows organizations to securely connect users to applications across multiple locations and over large geographical distances. 

## VPN Protocols:

A VPN, or virtual private network, is a network security service that changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you’re using a public network like the internet. VPNs provide a server that acts as a gateway between a computer and the internet. This server creates a path similar to a virtual tunnel that hides the computer’s IP address and encrypts the data in transit to the internet. The main purpose of a VPN is to create a secure connection between a computer and a network. Additionally, a VPN allows trusted connections to be established on non-trusted networks. VPN protocols determine how the secure network tunnel is formed. Different VPN providers provide different VPN protocols.

This reading will cover the differences between remote access and site-to-site VPNs, and two VPN protocols: WireGuard VPN and IPSec VPN. A VPN protocol is similar to a network protocol: It’s a set of rules or instructions that will determine how data moves between endpoints. An endpoint is any device connected on a network. Some examples of endpoints include computers, mobile devices, and servers.

Remote access and site-to-site VPNs  
Individual users use remote access VPNs to establish a connection between a personal device and a VPN server. Remote access VPNs encrypt data sent or received through a personal device. The connection between the user and the remote access VPN is established through the internet.

Enterprises use site-to-site VPNs largely to extend their network to other networks and locations. This is particularly useful for organizations that have many offices across the globe. IPSec is commonly used in site-to-site VPNs to create an encrypted tunnel between the primary network and the remote network. One disadvantage of site-to-site VPNs is how complex they can be to configure and manage compared to remote VPNs.

WireGuard VPN vs. IPSec VPN  
WireGuard and IPSec are two different VPN protocols used to encrypt traffic over a secure network tunnel. The majority of VPN providers offer a variety of options for VPN protocols, such as WireGuard or IPSec. Ultimately, choosing between IPSec and WireGuard depends on many factors, including connection speeds, compatibility with existing network infrastructure, and business or individual needs.

WireGuard VPN  
WireGuard is a high-speed VPN protocol, with advanced encryption, to protect users when they are accessing the internet. It’s designed to be simple to set up and maintain. WireGuard can be used for both site-to-site connection and client-server connections. WireGuard is relatively newer than IPSec, and is used by many people due to the fact that its download speed is enhanced by using fewer lines of code. WireGuard is also open source, which makes it easier for users to deploy and debug. This protocol is useful for processes that require faster download speeds, such as streaming video content or downloading large files.

IPSec VPN  
IPSec is another VPN protocol that may be used to set up VPNs. Most VPN providers use IPSec to encrypt and authenticate data packets in order to establish secure, encrypted connections. Since IPSec is one of the earlier VPN protocols, many operating systems support IPSec from VPN providers.

Although IPSec and WireGuard are both VPN protocols, IPSec is older and more complex than WireGuard. Some clients may prefer IPSec due to its longer history of use, extensive security testing, and widespread adoption. However, others may prefer WireGuard because of its potential for better performance and simpler configuration.

## How intrusions compromise your system:

Network interception attacks   
Network interception attacks work by intercepting network traffic and stealing valuable information or interfering with the transmission in some way.

Malicious actors can use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit. This is referred to as packet sniffing. In addition to seeing information that they are not entitled to, malicious actors can also intercept network traffic and alter it. These attacks can cause damage to an organization’s network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering the message and interrupting network operations. For example, an attacker can intercept a bank transfer and change the account receiving the funds to one that the attacker controls.

Later in this course you will learn more about malicious packet sniffing, and other types of network interception attacks: on-path attacks and replay attacks.

Backdoor attacks  
A backdoor attack is another type of attack you will need to be aware of as a security analyst. An organization may have a lot of security measures in place, including cameras, biometric scans and access codes to keep employees from entering and exiting without being seen. However, an employee might work around the security measures by finding a backdoor to the building that is not as heavily monitored, allowing them to sneak out for the afternoon without being seen. 

In cybersecurity, backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmers or system and network administrators that bypass normal access control mechanisms. Backdoors are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks. However, backdoors can also be installed by attackers after they’ve compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.

Once the hacker has entered an insecure network through a backdoor, they can cause extensive damage: installing malware, performing a denial of service (DoS) attack, stealing private information or changing other security settings that leaves the system vulnerable to other attacks. A DoS attack is an attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.

Possible impacts on an organization  
As you’ve learned already, network attacks can have a significant negative impact on an organization. Let’s examine some potential consequences.

Financial: When a system is taken offline with a DoS attack or some other tactic, they prevent a company from performing  tasks that generate revenue. Depending on the size of an organization, interrupted operations can cost millions of dollars. Reparation costs to rebuild software infrastructure and to pay large sums associated with potential ransomware can be financially difficult. In addition, if a malicious actor gets access to the personal information of the company’s clients or customers, the company may face heavy litigation and settlement costs if customers seek legal recourse.

Reputation: Attacks can also have a negative impact on the reputation of an organization. If it becomes public knowledge that a company has experienced a cyber attack, the public may become concerned about the security practices of the organization. They may stop trusting the company with their personal information and choose a competitor to fulfill their needs.

Public safety: If an attack occurs on a government network, this can potentially impact the safety and welfare of the citizens of a country. In recent years, defense agencies across the globe are investing heavily in combating cyber warfare tactics. If a malicious actor gained access to a power grid, a public water system, or even a military defense communication system, the public could face physical harm due to a network intrusion attack.

## DoS Attack:

Denial of Service attack: A DoS attack is an attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.  
Distributed Denial of Service attack: A DDos is a kind of DoS attack that uses multiple devices or servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

A SYN flood attack is a type of DoS attack that simulates the TCP connection and floods the server with SYN packets.  
An ICMP flood attack is a type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP packets to a network server.  
A ping of death attack is a type of DoS attack that is caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64 kilobytes, the maximum size for a correctly formed ICMP packet.  
A botnet is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder." Each computer in the botnet can be remotely controlled to send a data packet to a target system. In a botnet attack, cyber criminals instruct all the bots on the botnet to send data packets to the target system at the same time, resulting in a DDoS attack.

## Network Protocol Analyzer and tcpdump:

A network protocol analyzer, sometimes called a packet sniffer or a packet analyzer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. They are commonly used as investigative tools to monitor networks and identify suspicious activity. There are a wide variety of network protocol analyzers available, but some of the most common analyzers  include:

SolarWinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer  
ManageEngine OpManager  
Azure Network Watcher  
Wireshark  
tcpdump

This reading will focus exclusively on tcpdump, though you can apply what you learn here to many of the other network protocol analyzers you'll use as a cybersecurity analyst to defend against any network intrusions. In an upcoming activity, you’ll review a tcpdump data traffic log and identify a DoS attack to practice these skills. 

tcpdump   
tcpdump is a command-line network protocol analyzer. It is popular, lightweight–meaning it uses little memory and has a low CPU usage–and uses the open-source libpcap library. tcpdump is text based, meaning all commands in tcpdump are executed in the terminal. It can also be installed on other Unix-based operating systems, such as macOS®. It is preinstalled on many Linux distributions.

tcpdump provides a brief packet analysis and converts key information about network traffic into formats easily read by humans. It prints information about each packet directly into your terminal. tcpdump also displays the source IP address, destination IP addresses, and the port numbers being used in the communications. 

Interpreting output  
tcpdump prints the output of the command as the sniffed packets in the command line, and optionally to a log file, after a command is executed. The output of a packet capture contains many pieces of important information about the network traffic. 

types of information presented in a tcpdump packet capture. Some information you receive from a packet capture includes: 

Timestamp: The output begins with the timestamp, formatted as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second.    
Source IP: The packet’s origin is provided by its source IP address.  
Source port: This port number is where the packet originated.  
Destination IP: The destination IP address is where the packet is being transmitted to.  
Destination port: This port number is where the packet is being transmitted to.

Note: By default, tcpdump will attempt to resolve host addresses to hostnames. It'll also replace port numbers with commonly associated services that use these ports.

Common uses  
tcpdump and other network protocol analyzers are commonly used to capture and view network communications and to collect statistics about the network, such as troubleshooting network performance issues. They can also be used to:

Establish a baseline for network traffic patterns and network utilization metrics.  
Detect and identify malicious traffic  
Create customized alerts to send the right notifications when network issues or security threats arise.  
Locate unauthorized instant messaging (IM), traffic, or wireless access points.

However, attackers can also use network protocol analyzers maliciously to gain information about a specific network. For example, attackers can capture data packets that contain sensitive information, such as account usernames and passwords. As a cybersecurity analyst, It’s important to understand the purpose and uses of network protocol analyzers.

## Network Attack Tactics and Defense:

A closer review of packet sniffing   
As you learned in a previous video, packet sniffing is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network. On a private network, data packets are directed to the matching destination device on the network. 

The device’s Network Interface Card (NIC) is a piece of hardware that connects the device to a network. The NIC reads the data transmission, and if it contains the device’s MAC address, it accepts the packet and sends it to the device to process the information based on the protocol. This occurs in all standard network operations. However, a NIC can be set to promiscuous mode, which means that it accepts all traffic on the network, even the packets that aren’t addressed to the NIC’s device. You’ll learn more about NIC’s later in the program. Malicious actors might use software like Wireshark to capture the data on a private network and store it for later use. They can then use the personal information to their own advantage. Alternatively, they might use the IP and MAC addresses of authorized users of the private network to perform IP spoofing.

A closer review of IP spoofing   
IP spoofing is a network attack performed when an attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network.

After a malicious actor has sniffed packets on the network, they can impersonate the IP and MAC addresses of authorized devices to perform an IP spoofing attack. Firewalls can prevent IP spoofing attacks by configuring it to refuse unauthorized IP packets and suspicious traffic. Next, you’ll examine a few common IP spoofing attacks that are important to be familiar with as a security analyst.

On-path attack  
An on-path attack happens when a hacker intercepts the communication between two devices or servers that have a trusted relationship. The transmission between these two trusted network devices could contain valuable information like usernames and passwords that the malicious actor can collect. An on-path attack is sometimes referred to as a meddler-in-the middle attack because the hacker is hiding in the middle of communications between two trusted parties.

Or, it could be that the intercepted transmission contains a DNS system look-up. You’ll recall from an earlier video that a DNS server translates website domain names into IP addresses. If a malicious actor intercepts a transmission containing a DNS lookup, they could spoof the DNS response from the server and redirect a domain name to a different IP address, perhaps one that contains malicious code or other threats. The most important way to protect against an on-path attack is to encrypt your data in transit, e.g. using TLS. 

Replay attack  
A replay attack is a network attack performed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at another time.

Smurf attack  
A smurf attack is a network attack that is performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized user’s IP address and floods it with packets. Once the spoofed packet reaches the broadcast address, it is sent to all of the devices and servers on the network. 

In a smurf attack, IP spoofing is combined with another denial of service (DoS) technique to flood the network with unwanted traffic. For example, the spoofed packet could include an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping. As you learned earlier, ICMP is used to troubleshoot a network. But if too many ICMP messages are transmitted, the ICMP echo responses overwhelm the servers on the network and they shut down. This creates a denial of service and can bring an organization’s operations to a halt.

An important way to protect against a smurf attack is to use an advanced firewall that can monitor any unusual traffic on the network. Most next generation firewalls (NGFW) include features that detect network anomalies to ensure that oversized broadcasts are detected before they have a chance to bring down the network.

DoS attack  
As you’ve learned, once the malicious actor has sniffed the network traffic, they can impersonate an authorized user. A Denial of Service attack is a class of attacks where the attacker prevents the compromised system from performing legitimate activity or responding to legitimate traffic. Unlike IP spoofing, however, the attacker will not receive a response from the targeted host. Everything about the data packet is authorized including the IP address in the header of the packet. In IP spoofing attacks, the malicious actor uses IP packets containing fake IP addresses. The attackers keep sending IP packets containing fake IP addresses until the network server crashes.

Pro Tip: Remember the principle of defense-in-depth. There isn’t one perfect strategy for stopping each kind of attack. You can layer your defense by using multiple strategies. In this case, using industry standard encryption will strengthen your security and help you defend from DoS attacks on more than one level.

## OS Hardening Practices:

OS: The operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user.  
Patch Update: A patch update is a software and operating system, or OS, update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.  
Baseline Configuration: A baseline configuration is a documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.  
MFA: A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.   
Brute force attacks  
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

Simple brute force attacks. When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.

Dictionary attacks use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks. 

Assessing vulnerabilities  
Before a brute force attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, companies can run a series of tests on their network or web applications to assess vulnerabilities. Analysts can use virtual machines and sandboxes to test suspicious files, check for vulnerabilities before an event occurs, or to simulate a cybersecurity incident.

Virtual machines (VMs)  
Virtual machines (VMs) are software versions of physical computers. VMs provide an additional layer of security for an organization because they can be used to run code in an isolated environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the rest of the computer or system. VMs can also be deleted and replaced by a pristine image after testing malware. 

VMs are useful when investigating potentially infected machines or running malware in a constrained environment. Using a VM may prevent damage to your system in the event its tools are used improperly. VMs also give you the ability to revert to a previous state. However, there are still some risks involved with VMs. There’s still a small risk that a malicious program can escape virtualization and access the host machine. 

You can test and explore applications easily with VMs, and it’s easy to switch between different VMs from your computer. This can also help in streamlining many security tasks.

Sandbox environments  
A sandbox is a type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network. They are commonly used for testing patches, identifying and addressing bugs, or detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Sandboxes can also be used to evaluate suspicious software, evaluate files containing malicious code, and simulate attack scenarios. 

Sandboxes can be stand-alone physical computers that are not connected to a network; however, it is often more time- and cost-effective to use software or cloud-based virtual machines as sandbox environments. Note that some malware authors know how to write code to detect if the malware is executed in a VM or sandbox environment. Attackers can program their malware to behave as harmless software when run inside these types of  testing environments. 

Prevention measures  
Some common measures organizations use to prevent brute force attacks and similar attacks from occurring include: 

Salting and hashing: Hashing converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. It is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to decrypt and obtain the original text. Salting adds random characters to hashed passwords. This increases the length and complexity of hash values, making them more secure.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two-factor authentication (2FA): MFA is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. This verification happens using a combination of authentication factors: a username and password, fingerprints, facial recognition, or a one-time password (OTP) sent to a phone number or email. 2FA is similar to MFA, except it uses only two forms of verification.

CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA: CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. It asks users to complete a simple test that proves they are human. This helps prevent software from trying to brute force a password. reCAPTCHA is a free CAPTCHA service from Google that helps protect websites from bots and malicious software.

Password policies: Organizations use password policies to standardize good password practices throughout the business. Policies can include guidelines on how complex a password should be, how often users need to update passwords, whether passwords can be reused or not, and if there are limits to how many times a user can attempt to log in before their account is suspended.

## Network Security Applications:

Firewall  
So far in this course, you learned about stateless firewalls, stateful firewalls, and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), and the security advantages of each of them.

Most firewalls are similar in their basic functions. Firewalls allow or block traffic based on a set of rules. As data packets enter a network, the packet header is inspected and allowed or denied based on its port number. NGFWs are also able to inspect packet payloads. Each system should have its own firewall, regardless of the network firewall.

A firewall circled by dashes, protecting the internal network from internet traffic that comes in through the mode.  
Intrusion Detection System   
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. An IDS alerts administrators based on the signature of malicious traffic.

The IDS is configured to detect known attacks. IDS systems often sniff data packets as they move across the network and analyze them for the characteristics of known attacks. Some IDS systems review not only for signatures of known attacks, but also for anomalies that could be the sign of malicious activity. When the IDS discovers an anomaly, it sends an alert to the network administrator who can then investigate further.

The limitations to IDS systems are that they can only scan for known attacks or obvious anomalies. New and sophisticated attacks might not be caught. The other limitation is that the IDS doesn’t actually stop the incoming traffic if it detects something awry. It’s up to the network administrator to catch the malicious activity before it does anything damaging to the network. 

An IDS circled above an image of a switch, which rests between a firewall and the network.  
When combined with a firewall, an IDS adds another layer of defense. The IDS is placed behind the firewall and before entering the LAN, which allows the IDS to analyze data streams after network traffic that is disallowed by the firewall has been filtered out. This is done to reduce noise in IDS alerts, also referred to as false positives.

Intrusion Prevention System   
An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an application that monitors system activity for intrusive activity and takes action to stop the activity. It offers even more protection than an IDS because it actively stops anomalies when they are detected, unlike the IDS that simply reports the anomaly to a network administrator.

An IPS searches for signatures of known attacks and data anomalies. An IPS reports the anomaly to security analysts and blocks a specific sender or drops network packets that seem suspect. 

An IPS is situated between a firewall and the internal network.  
The IPS (like an IDS) sits behind the firewall in the network architecture. This offers a high level of security because risky data streams are disrupted before they even reach sensitive parts of the network. However, one potential limitation is that it is inline: If it breaks, the connection between the private network and the internet breaks. Another limitation of IPS is the possibility of false positives, which can result in legitimate traffic getting dropped.

Full packet capture devices  
Full packet capture devices can be incredibly useful for network administrators and security professionals. These devices allow you to record and analyze all of the data that is transmitted over your network. They also aid in investigating alerts created by an IDS. 

Security Information and Event Management   
A security information and event management system (SIEM) is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools work in real time to report suspicious activity in a centralized dashboard. SIEM tools additionally analyze network log data sourced from IDSs, IPSs, firewalls, VPNs, proxies, and DNS logs. SIEM tools are a way to aggregate security event data so that it all appears in one place for security analysts to analyze. This is referred to as a single pane of glass. 

Below, you can review an example of a dashboard from Google Cloud’s SIEM tool, Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data.

Image of the Chronicle dashboard  
Splunk is another common SIEM tool. Splunk offers different SIEM tool options: Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. Both options include detailed dashboards which help security professionals to review and analyze an organization's data. There are also other similar SIEM tools available, and it's important for security professionals to research the different tools to determine which one is most beneficial to the organization.

A SIEM tool doesn’t replace the expertise of security analysts, or of the network- and system-hardening activities covered in this course, but they’re used in combination with other security methods. Security analysts often work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) where they can monitor the activity across the network. They can then use their expertise and experience to determine how to respond to the information on the dashboard and decide when the events meet the criteria to be escalated to oversight.

## Cloud Hardening:

Cloud network: A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet.   
Identity access management  
Identity access management (IAM) is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can use different cloud resources. A common problem that organizations face when using the cloud is the loose configuration of cloud user roles. An improperly configured user role increases risk by allowing unauthorized users to have access to critical cloud operations. 

Configuration  
The expanding cloud ecosystem introduces significant complexity to network management. Each cloud service necessitates precise configuration to uphold security and compliance standards. This challenge intensifies during cloud migrations, where ensuring accurate configuration for every migrated process is critical. Neglect in this area can expose the network to vulnerabilities. Misconfigured cloud services are a frequent source of security breaches, underscoring the importance of meticulous attention to detail by network administrators and architects during the migration and ongoing management of cloud services.

Attack surface   
Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer numerous applications and services for organizations at a low cost. 

Every service or application on a network carries its own set of risks and vulnerabilities and increases an organization’s overall attack surface. An increased attack surface must be compensated for with increased security measures.

Cloud networks that utilize many services introduce lots of entry points into an organization’s network. However, if the network is designed correctly, utilizing several services does not introduce more entry points into an organization’s network design. These entry points can be used to introduce malware onto the network and pose other security vulnerabilities. It is important to note that CSPs often defer to more secure options, and have undergone more scrutiny than a traditional on-premises network. 

Zero-day attacks  
Zero-day attacks are an important security consideration for organizations using cloud or traditional on-premise network solutions. A zero day attack is an exploit that was previously unknown. CSPs are more likely to know about a zero day attack occurring before a traditional IT organization does. CSPs have ways of patching hypervisors and migrating workloads to other virtual machines. These methods ensure the customers are not impacted by the attack. There are also several tools available for patching at the operating system level that organizations can use.

Visibility and tracking   
Network administrators have access to every data packet crossing the network with both on-premise and cloud networks. They can sniff and inspect data packets to learn about network performance or to check for possible threats and attacks.

This kind of visibility is also offered in the cloud through flow logs and tools, such as packet mirroring. CSPs take responsibility for security in the cloud, but they do not allow the organizations that use their infrastructure to monitor traffic on the CSP’s servers. Many CSPs offer strong security measures to protect their infrastructure. Still, this situation might be a concern for organizations that are accustomed to having full access to their network and operations. CSPs pay for third-party audits to verify how secure a cloud network is and identify potential vulnerabilities. The audits can help organizations identify whether any vulnerabilities originate from on-premise infrastructure and if there are any compliance lapses from their CSP. 

Things change fast in the cloud  
CSPs are large organizations that work hard to stay up-to-date with technology advancements. For organizations that are used to being in control of any adjustments made to their network, this can be a potential challenge to keep up with. Cloud service updates can affect security considerations for the organizations using them. For example, connection configurations might need to be changed based on the CSP’s updates. 

Organizations that use CSPs usually have to update their IT processes. It is possible for organizations to continue following established best practices for changes, configurations, and other security considerations. However, an organization might have to adopt a different approach in a way that aligns with changes made by the CSP. 

Cloud networking offers various options that might appear attractive to a small company—options that they could never afford to build on their own premises. However, it is important to consider that each service adds complexity to the security profile of the organization, and they will need security personnel to monitor all of the cloud services. 

Shared responsibility model  
A commonly accepted cloud security principle is the shared responsibility model. The shared responsibility model states that the CSP must take responsibility for security involving the cloud infrastructure, including physical data centers, hypervisors, and host operating systems. The company using the cloud service is responsible for the assets and processes that they store or operate in the cloud.

The shared responsibility model ensures that both the CSP and the users agree about where their responsibility for security begins and ends. A problem occurs when organizations assume that the CSP is taking care of security that they have not taken responsibility for. One example of this is cloud applications and configurations. The CSP takes responsibility for securing the cloud, but it is the organization’s responsibility to ensure that services are configured properly according to the security requirements of their organization.

Cloud security hardening  
There are various techniques and tools that can be used to secure cloud network infrastructure and resources. Some common cloud security hardening techniques include incorporating IAM, hypervisors, baselining, cryptography, and cryptographic erasure.

Identity access management (IAM)  
Identity access management (IAM) is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can leverage different cloud resources.

Hypervisors  
A hypervisor abstracts the host’s hardware from the operating software environment. There are two types of hypervisors. Type one hypervisors run on the hardware of the host computer. An example of a type one hypervisor is VMware®'s ESXi. Type two hypervisors operate on the software of the host computer. An example of a type two hypervisor is VirtualBox. Cloud service providers (CSPs) commonly use type one hypervisors. CSPs are responsible for managing the hypervisor and other virtualization components. The CSP ensures that cloud resources and cloud environments are available, and it  provides regular patches and updates. Vulnerabilities in hypervisors or misconfigurations can lead to virtual machine escapes (VM escapes). A VM escape is an exploit where a malicious actor gains access to the primary hypervisor, potentially the host computer and other VMs. As a CSP customer, you will rarely deal with hypervisors directly.

Baselining  
Baselining for cloud networks and operations cover how the cloud environment is configured and set up. A baseline is a fixed reference point. This reference point can be used to compare changes made to a cloud environment. Proper configuration and setup can greatly improve the security and performance of a cloud environment. Examples of establishing a baseline in a cloud environment include: restricting access to the admin portal of the cloud environment, enabling password management, enabling file encryption, and enabling threat detection services for SQL databases.

Cryptography in the cloud  
Cryptography can be applied to secure data that is processed and stored in a cloud environment. Cryptography uses encryption and secure key management systems to provide data integrity and confidentiality. Cryptographic encryption is one of the key ways to secure sensitive data and information in the cloud.

Encryption is the process of scrambling information into ciphertext, which is not readable to anyone without the encryption key. Encryption primarily originated from manually encoding messages and information using an algorithm to convert any given letter or number to a new value. Modern encryption relies on the secrecy of a key, rather than the secrecy of an algorithm. Cryptography is an important tool that helps secure cloud networks and data at rest to prevent unauthorized access. You’ll learn more about cryptography in-depth in an upcoming course.

Cryptographic erasure  
Cryptographic erasure is a method of erasing the encryption key for the encrypted data. When destroying data in the cloud, more traditional methods of data destruction are not as effective. Crypto-shredding is a newer technique where the cryptographic keys used for decrypting the data are destroyed. This makes the data undecipherable and prevents anyone from decrypting the data. When crypto-shredding, all copies of the key need to be destroyed so no one has any opportunity to access the data in the future.

Key Management  
Modern encryption relies on keeping the encryption keys secure. Below are the measures you can take to further protect your data when using cloud applications:

Trusted platform module (TPM). TPM is a computer chip that can securely store passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.

Cloud hardware security module (CloudHSM). CloudHSM is a computing device that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys and processes cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption.

Organizations and customers do not have access to the cloud service provider (CSP) directly, but they can request audits and security reports by contacting the CSP. Customers typically do not have access to the specific encryption keys that CSPs use to encrypt the customers’ data. However, almost all CSPs allow customers to provide their own encryption keys, depending on the service the customer is accessing. In turn, the customer is responsible for their encryption keys and ensuring the keys remain confidential. The CSP is limited in how they can help the customer if the customer’s keys are compromised or destroyed. One key benefit of the shared responsibility model is that the customer is not entirely responsible for maintenance of the cryptographic infrastructure. Organizations can assess and monitor the risk involved with allowing the CSP to manage the infrastructure by reviewing a CSPs audit and security controls. For federal contractors, FEDRAMP provides a list of verified CSPs.

# Course 4: Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

## Introduction to Operating Systems:

Common operating systems  
The following operating systems are useful to know in the security industry: Windows, macOS®, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and iOS.

Windows and macOS  
Windows and macOS are both common operating systems. The Windows operating system was introduced in 1985, and macOS was introduced in 1984\. Both operating systems are used in personal and enterprise computers. 

Windows is a closed-source operating system, which means the source code is not shared freely with the public. macOS is partially open source. It has some open-source components, such as macOS’s kernel. macOS also has some closed-source components. 

Linux  
The first version of Linux was released in 1991, and other major releases followed in the early 1990s. Linux is a completely open-source operating system, which means that anyone can access Linux and its source code. The open-source nature of Linux allows developers in the Linux community to collaborate.

Linux is particularly important to the security industry. There are some distributions that are specifically designed for security. Later in this course, you’ll learn about Linux and its importance to the security industry.

ChromeOS  
ChromeOS launched in 2011\. It’s partially open source and is derived from Chromium OS, which is completely open source. ChromeOS is frequently used in the education field.

Android and iOS  
Android and iOS are both mobile operating systems. Unlike the other operating systems mentioned, mobile operating systems are typically used in mobile devices, such as phones, tablets, and watches. Android was introduced for public use in 2008, and iOS was introduced in 2007\. Android is open source, and iOS is partially open source.

Operating systems and vulnerabilities  
Security issues are inevitable with all operating systems. An important part of protecting an operating system is keeping the system and all of its components up to date.

Legacy operating systems  
A legacy operating system is an operating system that is outdated but still being used. Some organizations continue to use legacy operating systems because software they rely on is not compatible with newer operating systems. This can be more common in industries that use a lot of equipment that requires embedded software—software that’s placed inside components of the equipment.

Legacy operating systems can be vulnerable to security issues because they’re no longer supported or updated. This means that legacy operating systems might be vulnerable to new threats. 

Other vulnerabilities  
Even when operating systems are kept up to date, they can still become vulnerable to attack. Below are several resources that include information on operating systems and their vulnerabilities.

Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC): A list of known vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services

Apple Security Updates: A list of security updates and information for Apple® operating systems, including macOS and iOS, and other products

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Report for Ubuntu: A list of known vulnerabilities affecting Ubuntu, which is a specific distribution of Linux

Google Cloud Security Bulletin: A list of known vulnerabilities affecting Google Cloud products and services

Keeping an operating system up to date is one key way to help the system stay secure. Because it can be difficult to keep all systems updated at all times, it’s important for security analysts to be knowledgeable about legacy operating systems and the risks they can create.

## Requests to the Operating System:

Booting the computer  
When you boot, or turn on, your computer, either a BIOS or UEFI microchip is activated. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is prevalent in older systems. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and replaces BIOS on more modern systems.

The BIOS and UEFI chips both perform the same function for booting the computer. BIOS was the standard chip until 2007, when UEFI chips increased in use. Now, most new computers include a UEFI chip. UEFI provides enhanced security features.

The BIOS or UEFI microchips contain a variety of loading instructions for the computer to follow. For example, one of the loading instructions is to verify the health of the computer’s hardware.

The last instruction from the BIOS or UEFI activates the bootloader. The bootloader is a software program that boots the operating system. Once the operating system has finished booting, your computer is ready for use.

Completing a task  
As previously discussed, operating systems help us use computers more efficiently. Once a computer has gone through the booting process, completing a task on a computer is a four-part process.

Shows a process that moves from user to application to operating systems and finally to hardware.  
User  
The first part of the process is the user. The user initiates the process by having something they want to accomplish on the computer. Right now, you’re a user\!  You’ve initiated the process of accessing this reading.

Application  
The application is the software program that users interact with to complete a task. For example, if you want to calculate something, you would use the calculator application. If you want to write a report, you would use a word processing application. This is the second part of the process.

Operating system  
The operating system receives the user’s request from the application. It’s the operating system’s job to interpret the request and direct its flow. In order to complete the task, the operating system sends it on to applicable components of the hardware. 

Hardware  
The hardware is where all the processing is done to complete the tasks initiated by the user. For example, when a user wants to calculate a number, the CPU figures out the answer. As another example, when a user wants to save a file, another component of the hardware, the hard drive, handles this task. 

After the work is done by the hardware, it sends the output back through the operating system to the application so that it can display the results to the user.

The OS at work behind the scenes  
Consider once again how a computer is similar to a car. There are processes that someone won’t directly observe when operating a car, but they do feel it move forward when they press the gas pedal. It’s the same with a computer. Important work happens inside a computer that you don’t experience directly. This work involves the operating system.

You can explore this through another analogy. The process of using an operating system is also similar to ordering at a restaurant. At a restaurant you place an order and get your food, but you don’t see what’s happening in the kitchen when the cooks prepare the food.

Ordering food is similar to using an application on a computer. When you order your food, you make a specific request like “a small soup, very hot.” When you use an application, you also make specific requests like “print three double-sided copies of this document.” 

You can compare the food you receive to what happens when the hardware sends output. You receive the food that you ordered. You receive the document that you wanted to print. 

Finally, the kitchen is like the OS. You don’t know what happens in the kitchen, but it’s critical in interpreting the request and ensuring you receive what you ordered. Similarly, though the work of the OS is not directly transparent to you, it’s critical in completing your tasks.

An example: Downloading a file from an internet browser  
Previously, you explored how operating systems, applications, and hardware work together by  examining a task involving a calculation. You can expand this understanding by exploring how the OS completes another task, downloading a file from an internet browser: 

First, the user decides they want to download a file that they found online, so they click on a download button near the file in the internet browser application.

Then, the internet browser communicates this action to the OS.

The OS sends the request to download the file to the appropriate hardware for processing.

The hardware begins downloading the file, and the OS sends this information to the internet browser application. The internet browser then informs the user when the file has been downloaded.

## Virtualization Technology:

What is a virtual machine?  
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual version of a physical computer. Virtual machines are one example of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of using software to create virtual representations of various physical machines. The term “virtual” refers to machines that don’t exist physically, but operate like they do because their software simulates physical hardware. Virtual systems don’t use dedicated physical hardware. Instead, they use software-defined versions of the physical hardware. This means that a single virtual machine has a virtual CPU, virtual storage, and other virtual hardware. Virtual systems are just code.

A dark gray computer with arrows to light gray computers that have “VM” on the screen and are surrounded by dotted lines.  
You can run multiple virtual machines using the physical hardware of a single computer. This involves dividing the resources of the host computer to be shared across all physical and virtual components. For example, Random Access Memory (RAM) is a hardware component used for short-term memory. If a computer has 16GB of RAM, it can host three virtual machines so that the physical computer and virtual machines each have 4GB of RAM. Also, each of these virtual machines would have their own operating system and function similarly to a typical computer.

Benefits of virtual machines  
Security professionals commonly use virtualization and virtual machines. Virtualization can increase security for many tasks and can also increase efficiency.

Security  
One benefit is that virtualization can provide an isolated environment, or a sandbox, on the physical host machine. When a computer has multiple virtual machines, these virtual machines are “guests” of the computer. Specifically, they are isolated from the host computer and other guest virtual machines. This provides a layer of security, because virtual machines can be kept separate from the other systems. For example, if an individual virtual machine becomes infected with malware, it can be dealt with more securely because it’s isolated from the other machines. A security professional could also intentionally place malware on a virtual machine to examine it in a more secure environment.

Note: Although using virtual machines is useful when investigating potentially infected machines or running malware in a constrained environment, there are still some risks. For example, a malicious program can escape virtualization and access the host machine. This is why you should never completely trust virtualized systems.

Efficiency  
Using virtual machines can also be an efficient and convenient way to perform security tasks. You can open multiple virtual machines at once and switch easily between them. This allows you to streamline security tasks, such as testing and exploring various applications.

You can compare the efficiency of a virtual machine to a city bus. A single city bus has a lot of room and is an efficient way to transport many people simultaneously. If city buses didn’t exist, then everyone on the bus would have to drive their own cars. This uses more gas, cars, and other resources than riding the city bus. 

Similar to how many people can ride one bus, many virtual machines can be hosted on the same physical machine. That way, separate physical machines aren't needed to perform certain tasks.

Managing virtual machines  
Virtual machines can be managed with a software called a hypervisor. Hypervisors help users manage multiple virtual machines and connect the virtual and physical hardware. Hypervisors also help with allocating the shared resources of the physical host machine to one or more virtual machines.

One hypervisor that is useful for you to be familiar with is the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). KVM is an open-source hypervisor that is supported by most major Linux distributions. It is built into the Linux kernel, which means it can be used to create virtual machines on any machine running a Linux operating system without the need for additional software.

Other forms of virtualization  
In addition to virtual machines, there are other forms of virtualization. Some of these virtualization technologies do not use operating systems. For example, multiple virtual servers can be created from a single physical server. Virtual networks can also be created to more efficiently use the hardware of a physical network.

## CLI vs GUI:

CLI vs. GUI  
A graphical user interface (GUI) is a user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer. A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. 

Display  
One notable difference between these two interfaces is how they appear on the screen. A GUI has graphics and icons, such as the icons on your desktop or taskbar for launching programs. In contrast, a CLI only has text. It looks similar to lines of code. 

Side by side comparison of a graphical user interface with icons and a command line interface with code.  
Function  
These two interfaces also differ in how they function. A GUI is an interface that only allows you to make one request at a time. However, a CLI allows you to make multiple requests at a time. 

Advantages of a CLI in cybersecurity    
The choice between using a GUI or CLI is partly based on personal preference, but security analysts should be able to use both interfaces. Using a CLI can provide certain advantages.

Efficiency  
Some prefer the CLI because it can be used more quickly when you know how to manage this interface. For a new user, a GUI might be more efficient because they’re easier for beginners to navigate. 

Because a CLI can accept multiple requests at one time, it’s more powerful when you need to perform multiple tasks efficiently. For example, if you had to create multiple new files in your system, you could quickly perform this task in a CLI. If you were using a GUI, this could take much longer, because you have to repeat the same steps for each new file.

History file  
For security analysts, using the Linux CLI is helpful because it records a history file of all the commands and actions in the CLI. If you were using a GUI, your actions are not necessarily saved in a history file.

For example, you might be in a situation where you’re responding to an incident using a playbook. The playbook’s instructions require you to run a series of different commands. If you used a CLI, you’d be able to go back to the history and ensure all of the commands were correctly used. This could be helpful if there were issues using the playbook and you had to review the steps you performed in the command line.

Additionally, if you suspect an attacker has compromised your system, you might be able to trace their actions using the history file.

## Linux Architecture:

User  
The user is the person interacting with a computer. They initiate and manage computer tasks. Linux is a multi-user system, which means that multiple users can use the same resources at the same time.

Applications  
An application is a program that performs a specific task. There are many different applications on your computer. Some applications typically come pre-installed on your computer, such as calculators or calendars. Other applications might have to be installed, such as some web browsers or email clients. In Linux, you'll often use a package manager to install applications. A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.

Shell  
The shell is the command-line interpreter. Everything entered into the shell is text based. The shell allows users to give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it. You can think of the shell as a translator between you and your computer. The shell translates the commands you enter so that the computer can perform the tasks you want.

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)  
The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of the Linux OS that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system. 

A directory is a file that organizes where other files are stored. Directories are sometimes called “folders,” and they can contain files or other directories. The FHS defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized so the operating system knows where to find specific data. 

Kernel  
The kernel is the component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. It communicates with the applications to route commands. The Linux kernel is unique to the Linux OS and is critical for allocating resources in the system. The kernel controls all major functions of the hardware, which can help get tasks expedited more efficiently.

Hardware  
The hardware is the physical components of a computer. You might be familiar with some hardware components, such as hard drives or CPUs. Hardware is categorized as either peripheral or internal.

Peripheral devices  
Peripheral devices are hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system. They are not core components needed to run the computer system. Peripheral devices can be added or removed freely. Examples of peripheral devices include monitors, printers, the keyboard, and the mouse.

Internal hardware  
Internal hardware are the components required to run the computer. Internal hardware includes a main circuit board and all components attached to it. This main circuit board is also called the motherboard. Internal hardware includes the following: 

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a computer’s main processor, which is used to perform general computing tasks on a computer. The CPU executes the instructions provided by programs, which enables these programs to run. 

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a hardware component used for short-term memory. It’s where data is stored temporarily as you perform tasks on your computer. For example, if you’re writing a report on your computer, the data needed for this is stored in RAM. After you’ve finished writing the report and closed down that program, this data is deleted from RAM. Information in RAM cannot be accessed once the computer has been turned off. The CPU takes the data from RAM to run programs. 

The hard drive is a hardware component used for long-term memory. It’s where programs and files are stored for the computer to access later. Information on the hard drive can be accessed even after a computer has been turned off and on again. A computer can have multiple hard drives.

## Linux Distributions:

KALI LINUX ™  
KALI LINUX ™ is an open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. This is because KALI LINUX ™, which is Debian-based, is pre-installed with many useful tools for penetration testing and digital forensics. A penetration test is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Digital forensics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack. These are key activities in the security industry. 

However, KALI LINUX ™ is not the only Linux distribution that is used in cybersecurity. 

Ubuntu  
Ubuntu is an open-source, user-friendly distribution that is widely used in security and other industries. It has both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). Ubuntu is also Debian-derived and includes common applications by default. Users can also download many more applications from a package manager, including security-focused tools. Because of its wide use, Ubuntu has an especially large number of community resources to support users.

Ubuntu is also widely used for cloud computing. As organizations migrate to cloud servers, cybersecurity work may more regularly involve Ubuntu derivatives.

Parrot  
Parrot is an open-source distribution that is commonly used for security. Similar to KALI LINUX ™, Parrot comes with pre-installed tools related to penetration testing and digital forensics. Like both KALI LINUX ™ and Ubuntu, it is based on Debian.

Parrot is also considered to be a user-friendly Linux distribution. This is because it has a GUI that many find easy to navigate. This is in addition to Parrot’s CLI.

Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®  
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a subscription-based distribution of Linux built for enterprise use. Red Hat is not free, which is a major difference from the previously mentioned distributions. Because it’s built and supported for enterprise use, Red Hat also offers a dedicated support team for customers to call about issues.

AlmaLinux  
AlmaLinux is a community-driven Linux distribution that was created as a stable replacement for CentOS. CentOS was an open-source distribution that is closely related to Red Hat, and its final stable release, CentOS 8, was in December 2021\. CentOS used source code published by Red Hat to provide a similar platform. AlmaLinux is designed to be a drop-in replacement for CentOS 8\. This ensures that applications and configurations that worked on CentOS will continue to function on AlmaLinux.

## Package Manager:

Introduction to package managers  
A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application. Some packages may be large enough to form applications on their own. 

Packages contain the files necessary for an application to be installed. These files include dependencies, which are supplemental files used to run an application. 

Package managers can help resolve any issues with dependencies and perform other management tasks. A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. Linux uses multiple package managers. 

Note: It’s important to use the most recent version of a package when possible. The most recent version has the most up-to-date bug fixes and security patches. These help keep your system more secure.

Types of package managers  
Many commonly used Linux distributions are derived from the same parent distribution. For example, KALI LINUX ™, Ubuntu, and Parrot all come from Debian. CentOS comes from Red Hat.

This knowledge is useful when installing applications because certain package managers work with certain distributions. For example, the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) can be used for Linux distributions derived from Red Hat, and package managers such as dpkg can be used for Linux distributions derived from Debian.

Different package managers typically use different file extensions. For example, Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) has files which use the .rpm file extension, such as Package-Version-Release\_Architecture.rpm. Package managers for Debian-derived Linux distributions, such as dpkg, have files which use the .deb file extension, such as Package\_Version-Release\_Architecture.deb.

Package management tools  
In addition to package managers like RPM and dpkg, there are also package management tools that allow you to easily work with packages through the shell. Package management tools are sometimes utilized instead of package managers because they allow users to more easily perform basic tasks, such as installing a new package. Two notable tools are the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM).

Advanced Package Tool (APT)   
APT is a tool used with Debian-derived distributions. It is run from the command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages.

Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM)  
YUM is a tool used with Red Hat-derived distributions. It is run from the command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages. YUM works with .rpm files.

## Shell and its types:

Communicate through a shell  
As you explored previously, the shell is the command-line interpreter. You can think of a shell as a translator between you and the computer system. Shells allow you to give commands to the computer and receive responses from it. When you enter a command into a shell, the shell executes many internal processes to interpret your command, send it to the kernel, and return your results.

Types of shells  
The many different types of Linux shells include the following:

Bourne-Again Shell (bash)

C Shell (csh)

Korn Shell (ksh)

Enhanced C shell (tcsh)

Z Shell (zsh)

All Linux shells use common Linux commands, but they can differ in other features. For example, ksh and bash use the dollar sign ($) to indicate where users type in their commands. Other shells, such as zsh, use the percent sign (%) for this purpose.

Bash  
Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions. It’s considered a user-friendly shell. You can use bash for basic Linux commands as well as larger projects.

Bash is also the most popular shell in the cybersecurity profession. You’ll use bash throughout this course as you learn and practice Linux commands.

## Navigate Linux:

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)  
Previously, you learned that the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of Linux that organizes data. The FHS is important because it defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized in the operating system.

This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of relationships under the FHS:

Flowchart starts with the root directory at the top and branches down into multiple subdirectories.  
Under the FHS, a file’s location can be described by a file path. A file path is the location of a file or directory. In the file path, the different levels of the hierarchy are separated by a forward slash (/).

Root directory  
The root directory is the highest-level directory in Linux, and it’s always represented with a forward slash (/).  All subdirectories branch off the root directory. Subdirectories can continue branching out to as many levels as necessary.

Standard FHS directories  
Directly below the root directory, you’ll find standard FHS directories. In the diagram, home, bin, and etc are standard FHS directories. Here are a few examples of what standard directories contain:

/home: Each user in the system gets their own home directory.

/bin: This directory stands for “binary” and contains binary files and other executables. Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions.

/etc: This directory stores the system’s configuration files.

/tmp: This directory stores many temporary files. The /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.

/mnt: This directory stands for “mount” and stores media, such as USB drives and hard drives.

Pro Tip: You can use the man hier command to learn more about the FHS and its standard directories.

User-specific subdirectories  
Under home are subdirectories for specific users. In the diagram, these users are  analyst and analyst2. Each user has their own personal subdirectories, such as projects, logs, or reports.

Note: When the path leads to a subdirectory below the user’s home directory, the user’s home directory can be represented as the tilde (\~). For example, /home/analyst/logs can also be represented as \~/logs.

You can navigate to specific subdirectories using their absolute or relative file paths. The absolute file path is the full file path, which starts from the root. For example, /home/analyst/projects is an absolute file path. The relative file path is the file path that starts from a user's current directory.

Note: Relative file paths can use a dot (.) to represent the current directory, or two dots (..) to represent the parent of the current directory. An example of a relative file path could be ../projects.

Key commands for navigating the file system  
The following Linux commands can be used to navigate the file system: pwd, ls, and cd.

pwd  
The pwd command prints the working directory to the screen. Or in other words, it returns the directory that you’re currently in. 

The output gives you the absolute path to this directory. For example, if you’re in your home directory and your username is analyst, entering pwd returns /home/analyst. 

Pro Tip: To learn what your username is, use the whoami command. The whoami command returns the username of the current user. For example, if your username is analyst, entering whoami returns analyst.

ls  
The ls command displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory. For example, in the video, ls returned directories such as logs, and a file called updates.txt. 

Note: If you want to return the contents of a directory that’s not your current working directory, you can add an argument after ls with the absolute or relative file path to the desired directory. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory but want to list the contents of its projects subdirectory, you can enter ls /home/analyst/projects or just ls projects.

cd  
The cd command navigates between directories. When you need to change directories, you should use this command.

To navigate to a subdirectory of the current directory, you can add an argument after cd with the subdirectory name. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory and want to navigate to its projects subdirectory, you can enter cd projects.

You can also navigate to any specific directory by entering the absolute file path. For example, if you’re in /home/analyst/projects, entering cd /home/analyst/logs changes your current directory to /home/analyst/logs.

Pro Tip: You can use the relative file path and enter cd .. to go up one level in the file structure. For example, if the current directory is /home/analyst/projects, entering cd .. would change your working directory to /home/analyst. 

Common commands for reading file content  
The following Linux commands are useful for reading file content: cat, head, tail, and less.

cat  
The cat command displays the content of a file. For example, entering cat updates.txt returns everything in the updates.txt file.

head  
The head command displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines. The head command can be useful when you want to know the basic contents of a file but don’t need the full contents. Entering head updates.txt returns only the first 10 lines of the updates.txt file.

Pro Tip: If you want to change the number of lines returned by head, you can specify the number of lines by including \-n. For example, if you only want to display the first five lines of the updates.txt file, enter head \-n 5 updates.txt.

tail  
The tail command does the opposite of head. This command can be used to display just the end of a file, by default 10 lines. Entering tail updates.txt returns only the last 10 lines of the updates.txt file.

Pro Tip: You can use tail to read the most recent information in a log file.

less  
The less command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering less updates.txt changes the terminal window to display the contents of updates.txt one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward and backward through the content. 

Once you’ve accessed your content with the less command, you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:

Space bar: Move forward one page

b: Move back one page

Down arrow: Move forward one line

Up arrow: Move back one line

q: Quit and return to the previous terminal window

## Filter Content in Linux:

Filtering for information  
You previously explored how filtering for information is an important skill for security analysts. Filtering is selecting data that match a certain condition. For example, if you had a virus in your system that only affected the .txt files, you could use filtering to find these files quickly. Filtering allows you to search based on specific criteria, such as file extension or a string of text.

grep  
The grep command searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string or text. The grep command commonly takes two arguments: a specific string to search for and a specific file to search through.

For example, entering grep OS updates.txt returns all lines containing OS in the updates.txt file. In this example, OS is the specific string to search for, and updates.txt is the specific file to search through.

Let’s look at another example: grep error time\_logs.txt. Here grep is used to search for the text pattern. error is the term you are looking for in the time\_logs.txt file. When you run this command, grep will scan the time\_logs.txt file and print only the lines containing the word error.

Piping  
The pipe command is accessed using the pipe character (|). Piping sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing. As a reminder, standard output is information returned by the OS through the shell, and standard input is information received by the OS via the command line. 

The pipe character (|) is located in various places on a keyboard. On many keyboards, it’s located on the same key as the backslash character (\\). On some keyboards, the | can look different and have a small space through the middle of the line. If you can’t find the |, search online for its location on your particular keyboard. 

When used with grep, the pipe can help you find directories and files containing a specific word in their names. For example, ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users returns the file and directory names in the reports directory that contain users. Before the pipe, ls indicates to list the names of the files and directories in reports. Then, it sends this output to the command after the pipe. In this case, grep users returns all of the file or directory names containing users from the input it received.

Note: Piping is a general form of redirection in Linux and can be used for multiple tasks other than filtering. You can think of piping as a general tool that you can use whenever you want the output of one command to become the input of another command.

find  
The find command searches for directories and files that meet specified criteria. There’s a wide range of criteria that can be specified with find. For example, you can search for files and directories that

Contain a specific string in the name,

Are a certain file size, or

Were last modified within a certain time frame.

When using find, the first argument after find indicates where to start searching. For example, entering find /home/analyst/projects searches for everything starting at the projects directory. 

After this first argument, you need to indicate your criteria for the search. If you don’t include a specific search criteria with your second argument, your search will likely return a lot of directories and files. 

Specifying criteria involves options. Options modify the behavior of a command and commonly begin with a hyphen (-). 

\-name and \-iname  
One key criteria analysts might use with find is to find file or directory names that contain a specific string. The specific string you’re searching for must be entered in quotes after the \-name or \-iname options. The difference between these two options is that \-name is case-sensitive, and \-iname is not. 

For example, you might want to find all files in the projects directory that contain the word “log” in the file name. To do this, you’d enter find /home/analyst/projects \-name "\*log\*". You could also enter find /home/analyst/projects \-iname "\*log\*".

In these examples, the output would be all files in the projects directory that contain log surrounded by zero or more characters. The "\*log\*" portion of the command is the search criteria that indicates to search for the string “log”. When \-name is the option, files with names that include Log or LOG, for example, wouldn’t be returned because this option is case-sensitive. However, they would be returned when \-iname is the option.

Note: An asterisk (\*) is used as a wildcard to represent zero or more unknown characters.

\-mtime  
Security analysts might also use find to find files or directories last modified within a certain time frame. The \-mtime option can be used for this search. For example, entering find /home/analyst/projects \-mtime \-3 returns all files and directories in the projects directory that have been modified within the past three days. 

The \-mtime option search is based on days, so entering \-mtime \+1 indicates all files or directories last modified more than one day ago, and entering \-mtime \-1 indicates all files or directories last modified less than one day ago. 

Note: The option \-mmin can be used instead of \-mtime if you want to base the search on minutes rather than days.

## Manage Directories and Files:

Creating and modifying directories  
mkdir  
The mkdir command creates a new directory. Like all of the commands presented in this reading, you can either provide the new directory as the absolute file path, which starts from the root, or as a relative file path, which starts from your current directory.

For example, if you want to create a new directory called network in your /home/analyst/logs directory, you can enter mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network to create this new directory. If you’re already in the /home/analyst/logs directory, you can also create this new directory by entering mkdir network.

Pro Tip: You can use the ls command to confirm the new directory was added.

rmdir  
The rmdir command removes, or deletes, a directory. For example, entering rmdir /home/analyst/logs/network would remove this empty directory from the file system.

Note: The rmdir command cannot delete directories with files or subdirectories inside. For example, entering rmdir /home/analyst returns an error message. 

Creating and modifying files  
touch and rm  
The touch command creates a new file. This file won’t have any content inside. If your current directory is /home/analyst/reports, entering touch permissions.txt creates a new file in the reports subdirectory called permissions.txt.

The rm command removes, or deletes, a file. This command should be used carefully because it’s not easy to recover files deleted with rm. To remove the permissions file you just created, enter rm permissions.txt. 

Pro Tip: You can verify that permissions.txt was successfully created or removed by entering ls.

mv and cp  
You can also use mv and cp when working with files. The mv command moves a file or directory to a new location, and the cp command copies a file or directory into a new location. The first argument after mv or cp is the file or directory you want to move or copy, and the second argument is the location you want to move or copy it to.

To move permissions.txt into the logs subdirectory, enter mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs. Moving a file removes the file from its original location. However, copying a file doesn’t remove it from its original location. To copy permissions.txt into the logs subdirectory while also keeping it in its original location, enter cp permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs.

Note: The mv command can also be used to rename files. To rename a file, pass the new name in as the second argument instead of the new location. For example, entering mv permissions.txt perm.txt renames the permissions.txt file to perm.txt.

nano text editor  
nano is a command-line file editor that is available by default in many Linux distributions. Many beginners find it easy to use, and it’s widely used in the security profession. You can perform multiple basic tasks in nano, such as creating new files and modifying file contents. 

To open an existing file in nano from the directory that contains it, enter nano followed by the file name. For example, entering nano permissions.txt from the /home/analyst/reports directory opens a new nano editing window with the permissions.txt file open for editing. You can also provide the absolute file path to the file if you’re not in the directory that contains it.

You can also create a new file in nano by entering nano followed by a new file name. For example, entering nano authorized\_users.txt from the /home/analyst/reports directory creates the authorized\_users.txt file within that directory and opens it in a new nano editing window.

Since there isn't an auto-saving feature in nano, it’s important to save your work before exiting. To save a file in nano, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl \+ O. You’ll be prompted to confirm the file name before saving. To exit out of nano, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl \+ X.

Note: Vim and Emacs are also popular command-line text editors.

Standard output redirection  
There’s an additional way you can write to files. Previously, you learned about standard input and standard output. Standard input is information received by the OS via the command line, and standard output is information returned by the OS through the shell.

You’ve also learned about piping. Piping sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing. It uses the pipe character (|). 

In addition to the pipe (|), you can also use the right angle bracket (\>) and double right angle bracket (\>\>) operators to redirect standard output.

When used with echo, the \> and \>\> operators can be used to send the output of echo to a specified file rather than the screen. The difference between the two is that \> overwrites your existing file, and \>\> adds your content to the end of the existing file instead of overwriting it. The \> operator should be used carefully, because it’s not easy to recover overwritten files.

When you’re inside the directory containing the permissions.txt file, entering echo "last updated date" \>\> permissions.txt adds the string “last updated date” to the file contents. Entering echo "time" \> permissions.txt after this command overwrites the entire file contents of permissions.txt with the string “time”.

Note: Both the \> and \>\> operators will create a new file if one doesn’t already exist with your specified name.

## Permission Commands:

Reading permissions  
In Linux, permissions are represented with a 10-character string. Permissions include:

read: for files, this is the ability to read the file contents; for directories, this is the ability to read all contents in the directory including both files and subdirectories

write: for files, this is the ability to make modifications on the file contents; for directories, this is the ability to create new files in the directory

execute: for files, this is the ability to execute the file if it’s a program; for directories, this is the ability to enter the directory and access its files

These permissions are given to these types of owners:

user: the owner of the file

group: a larger group that the owner is a part of

other: all other users on the system

Each character in the 10-character string conveys different information about these permissions. The following table describes the purpose of each character:

Character

Example

\- if the other owner type lacks execute permissions

Exploring existing permissions  
You can use the ls command to investigate who has permissions on files and directories. Previously, you learned that ls displays the names of files in directories in the current working directory.

There are additional options you can add to the ls command to make your command more specific. Some of these options provide details about permissions. Here are a few important ls options for security analysts:

ls \-a: Displays hidden files. Hidden files start with a period (.) at the beginning.

ls \-l: Displays permissions to files and directories. Also displays other additional information, including owner name, group, file size, and the time of last modification.

ls \-la: Displays permissions to files and directories, including hidden files. This is a combination of the other two options.

Changing permissions  
The principle of least privilege is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function. In other words, users should not have privileges that are beyond what is necessary. Not following the principle of least privilege can create security risks.

The chmod  command can help you manage this authorization. The chmod command changes permissions on files and directories.

Using chmod  
The chmod command requires two arguments. The first argument indicates how to change permissions, and the second argument indicates the file or directory that you want to change permissions for.  For example, the following command would add all permissions to login\_sessions.txt:

chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx login\_sessions.txt

If you wanted to take all the permissions away, you could use

chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx login\_sessions.txt

Another way to assign these permissions is to use the equals sign (=) in this first argument. Using \= with chmod sets, or assigns, the permissions exactly as specified. For example, the following command would set read permissions for login\_sessions.txt for user, group, and other:

chmod u=r,g=r,o=r login\_sessions.txt

This command overwrites existing permissions. For instance, if the user previously had write permissions, these write permissions are removed after you specify only read permissions with \=. 

The following table reviews how each character is used within the first argument of chmod:

Character

Description

u

indicates changes will be made to user permissions

g

indicates changes will be made to group permissions

o

indicates changes will be made to other permissions

\+

adds permissions to the user, group, or other

\-

removes permissions from the user, group, or other

\=

assigns permissions for the user, group, or other

Note: When there are permission changes to more than one owner type, commas are needed to separate changes for each owner type. You should not add spaces after those commas.

The principle of least privilege in action  
As a security analyst, you may encounter a situation like this one: There’s a file called bonuses.txt within a compensation directory. The owner of this file is a member of the Human Resources department with a username of hrrep1. It has been decided that hrrep1 needs access to this file. But, since this file contains confidential information, no one else in the hr group needs access.

You run ls \-l to check the permissions of files in the compensation directory and discover that the permissions for bonuses.txt are \-rw-rw----. The group owner type has read and write permissions that do not align with the principle of least privilege.  

To remedy the situation, you input chmod g-rw bonuses.txt. Now, only the user who needs to access this file to carry out their job responsibilities can access this file.

## Adding and Deleting Users and Ownerships:

Responsible use of sudo  
To manage authorization and authentication, you need to be a root user, or a user with elevated privileges to modify the system. The root user can also be called the “super user.” You become a root user by logging in as the root user. However, running commands as the root user is not recommended in Linux because it can create security risks if malicious actors compromise that account. It’s also easy to make irreversible mistakes, and the system can’t track who ran a command. For these reasons, rather than logging in as the root user, it’s recommended you use sudo in Linux when you need elevated privileges.

The sudo command temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users. The name of this command comes from “super user do.” Users must be given access in a configuration file to use sudo. This file is called the “sudoers file.” Although using sudo is preferable to logging in as the root user, it's important to be aware that users with the elevated permissions to use sudo might be more at risk in the event of an attack.

You can compare this to a hotel with a master key. The master key can be used to access any room in the hotel. There are some workers at the hotel who need this key to perform their work. For example, to clean all the rooms, the janitor would scan their ID badge and then use this master key. However, if someone outside the hotel’s network gained access to the janitor’s ID badge and master key, they could access any room in the hotel. In this example, the janitor with the master key represents a user using sudo for elevated privileges. Because of the dangers of sudo, only users who really need to use it should have these permissions.

Additionally, even if you need access to sudo, you should be careful about using it with only the commands you need and nothing more. Running commands with sudo allows users to bypass the typical security controls that are in place to prevent elevated access to an attacker.

Note: Be aware of sudo if copying commands from an online source. It’s important you don’t use sudo accidentally. 

Authentication and authorization with sudo  
You can use sudo with many authentication and authorization management tasks. As a reminder, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, and authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. Some of the key commands used for these tasks include the following:

useradd  
The useradd command adds a user to the system. To add a user with the username of fgarcia with sudo, enter sudo useradd fgarcia. There are additional options you can use with useradd:

\-g: Sets the user’s default group, also called their primary group

\-G: Adds the user to additional groups, also called supplemental or secondary groups

To use the \-g option, the primary group must be specified after \-g. For example, entering sudo useradd \-g security fgarcia adds fgarcia as a new user and assigns their primary group to be security.

To use the \-G option, the supplemental group must be passed into the command after \-G. You can add more than one supplemental group at a time with the \-G option. Entering sudo useradd \-G finance,admin fgarcia adds fgarcia as a new user and adds them to the existing finance and admin groups.

usermod  
The usermod command modifies existing user accounts. The same \-g and \-G options from the useradd command can be used with usermod if a user already exists. 

To change the primary group of an existing user, you need the \-g option. For example, entering sudo usermod \-g executive fgarcia would change fgarcia’s primary group to the executive group.

To add a supplemental group for an existing user, you need the \-G option. You also need a \-a option, which appends the user to an existing group and is only used with the \-G option. For example, entering sudo usermod \-a \-G marketing fgarcia would add the existing fgarcia user to the supplemental marketing group.

Note: When changing the supplemental group of an existing user, if you don't include the \-a option, \-G will replace any existing supplemental groups with the groups specified after usermod.  Using \-a with \-G ensures that the new groups are added but existing groups are not replaced.

There are other options you can use with usermod to specify how you want to modify the user, including:

\-d: Changes the user’s home directory.

\-l: Changes the user’s login name.

\-L: Locks the account so the user can’t log in.

The option always goes after the usermod command. For example, to change fgarcia’s home directory to /home/garcia\_f, enter sudo usermod \-d /home/garcia\_f fgarcia. The option \-d directly follows the command usermod before the other two needed arguments.

userdel  
The userdel command deletes a user from the system. For example, entering sudo userdel fgarcia deletes fgarcia as a user. Be careful before you delete a user using this command.

The userdel command doesn’t delete the files in the user’s home directory unless you use the \-r option. Entering sudo userdel \-r fgarcia would delete fgarcia as a user and delete all files in their home directory. Before deleting any user files, you should ensure you have backups in case you need them later.

Note: Instead of deleting the user, you could consider deactivating their account with usermod \-L. This prevents the user from logging in while still giving you access to their account and associated permissions. For example, if a user left an organization, this option would allow you to identify which files they have ownership over, so you could move this ownership to other users.

chown  
The chown command changes ownership of a file or directory. You can use chown to change user or group ownership. To change the user owner of the access.txt file to fgarcia, enter sudo chown fgarcia access.txt. To change the group owner of access.txt to security, enter sudo chown :security access.txt. You must enter a colon (:) before security to designate it as a group name.

Similar to useradd, usermod, and userdel, there are additional options that can be used with chown.

## Linux Resources:

Linux community  
Linux has a large online community, and this is a huge resource for Linux users of all levels. You can likely find the answers to your questions with a simple online search. Troubleshooting issues by searching and reading online is an effective way to discover how others approached your issue. It’s also a great way for beginners to learn more about Linux.

The   
UNIX and Linux Stack Exchange  
 is a trusted resource for troubleshooting Linux issues. The Unix and Linux Stack Exchange is a question and answer website where community members can ask and answer questions about Linux. Community members vote on answers, so the higher quality answers are displayed at the top. Many of the questions are related to specific topics from advanced users, and the topics might help you troubleshoot issues as you continue using Linux.

Integrated Linux support  
Linux also has several commands that you can use for support.

man  
The man command displays information on other commands and how they work. It’s short for “manual.” To search for information on a command, enter the command after man. For example, entering man chown returns detailed information about chown, including the various options you can use with it. The output of the man command is also called a “man page.”

apropos  
The apropos command searches the man page descriptions for a specified string. Man pages can be lengthy and difficult to search through if you’re looking for a specific keyword. To use apropos, enter the keyword after apropos. 

You can also include the \-a option to search for multiple words. For example, entering apropos \-a graph editor outputs man pages that contain both the words “graph" and "editor” in their descriptions.

whatis  
The whatis command displays a description of a command on a single line. For example, entering whatis nano outputs the description of nano. This command is useful when you don't need a detailed description, just a general idea of the command. This might be as a reminder. Or, it might be after you discover a new command through a colleague or online resource and want to know more.

## SQL Filtering vs Linux Filtering:

Accessing SQL  
There are many interfaces for accessing SQL and many different versions of SQL. One way to access SQL is through the Linux command line.

To access SQL from Linux, you need to type in a command for the version of SQL that you want to use. For example, if you want to access SQLite, you can enter the command sqlite3 in the command line.

After this, any commands typed in the command line will be directed to SQL instead of Linux commands.

Differences between Linux and SQL filtering   
Although both Linux and SQL allow you to filter through data, there are some differences that affect which one you should choose.

Purpose  
Linux filters data in the context of files and directories on a computer system. It’s used for tasks like searching for specific files, manipulating file permissions, or managing processes. 

SQL is used to filter data within a database management system. It’s used for querying and manipulating data stored in tables and retrieving specific information based on defined criteria. 

Syntax  
Linux uses various commands and command-line options specific to each filtering tool. Syntax varies depending on the tool and purpose. Some examples of Linux commands are find, sed, cut, e grep

SQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized language with specific keywords and clauses for filtering data across different SQL databases. Some examples of SQL keywords and clauses are WHERE, SELECT, JOIN

Structure  
SQL offers a lot more structure than Linux, which is more free-form and not as tidy.

For example, if you wanted to access a log of employee log-in attempts, SQL would have each record separated into columns. Linux would print the data as a line of text without this organization. As a result, selecting a specific column to analyze would be easier and more efficient in SQL.

In terms of structure, SQL provides results that are more easily readable and that can be adjusted more quickly than when using Linux.

Joining tables  
Some security-related decisions require information from different tables. SQL allows the analyst to join multiple tables together when returning data. Linux doesn’t have that same functionality; it doesn’t allow data to be connected to other information on your computer. This is more restrictive for an analyst going through security logs.

Best uses  
As a security analyst, it’s important to understand when you can use which tool. Although SQL has a more organized structure and allows you to join tables, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t situations that would require you to filter data in Linux.

A lot of data used in cybersecurity will be stored in a database format that works with SQL. However, other logs might be in a format that is not compatible with SQL. For instance, if the data is stored in a text file, you cannot search through it with SQL. In those cases, it is useful to know how to filter in Linux.

## SQL Querying:

Basic SQL query  
There are two essential keywords in any SQL query: SELECT and FROM. You will use these keywords every time you want to query a SQL database. Using them together helps SQL identify what data you need from a database and the table you are returning it from.

The video demonstrated this SQL query:

SELECT employee\_id, device\_id

FROM employees;

In readings and quizzes, this course uses a sample database called the Chinook database to run queries. The Chinook database includes data that might be created at a digital media company. A security analyst employed by this company might need to query this data.  For example, the database contains eleven tables, including an employees table, a customers table, and an invoices table. These tables include data such as names and addresses.  

As an example, you can run this query to return data from the customers table of the Chinook database:  
SELECT customerid, city, country  
FROM customers;

SELECT  
The SELECT keyword indicates which columns to return. For example, you can return the customerid column from the Chinook database with

SELECT customerid

You can also select multiple columns by separating them with a comma. For example, if you want to return both the customerid and city columns, you should write SELECT customerid, city.

If you want to return all columns in a table, you can follow the SELECT keyword with an asterisk (\*). The first line in the query will be SELECT \*.

Note: Although the tables you're querying in this course are relatively small, using SELECT \* may not be advisable when working with large databases and tables; in those cases, the final output may be difficult to understand and might be slow to run. 

FROM  
The SELECT keyword always comes with the FROM keyword. FROM indicates which table to query. To use the FROM keyword, you should write it after the SELECT keyword, often on a new line, and follow it with the name of the table you’re querying. If you want to return all columns from the customers table, you can write:

SELECT \*

FROM customers;

When you want to end the query here, you put a semicolon (;) at the end to tell SQL that this is the entire query.

Note: Line breaks are not necessary in SQL queries, but are often used to make the query easier to understand. If you prefer, you can also write the previous query on one line as

SELECT \* FROM customers;

ORDER BY  
Database tables are often very complicated, and this is where other SQL keywords come in handy. ORDER BY is an important keyword for organizing the data you extract from a table.

ORDER BY sequences the records returned by a query based on a specified column or columns. This can be in either ascending or descending order.

Sorting in ascending order  
To use the ORDER BY keyword, write it at the end of the query and specify a column to base the sort on. In this example, SQL will return the customerid, city, and country columns from the customers table, and the records will be sequenced by the city column:  
SELECT customerid, city, country  
FROM customers  
ORDER BY city;

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records based on the column specified after this keyword. By default, as shown in this example, the sequence will be in ascending order. This means

if you choose a column containing numeric data, it sorts the output from the smallest to largest. For example, if sorting on customerid, the ID numbers are sorted from smallest to largest.

if the column contains alphabetic characters, such as in the example with the city column, it orders the records from the beginning of the alphabet to the end. 

Sorting in descending order  
You can also use the ORDER BY with the DESC keyword to sort in descending order. The DESC keyword is short for "descending" and tells SQL to sort numbers from largest to smallest, or alphabetically from Z to A. This can be done by following ORDER BY with the DESC keyword. For example, you can run this query to examine how the results differ when DESC is applied:   
SELECT customerid, city, country  
FROM customers  
ORDER BY city DESC;

Now, cities at the end of the alphabet are listed first.

Sorting based on multiple columns  
You can also choose multiple columns to order by. For example, you might first choose the country and then the city column. SQL then sorts the output by country, and for rows with the same country, it sorts them based on city. You can run this to explore how SQL displays this:  
SELECT customerid, city, country  
FROM customers  
ORDER BY country, city;

## Filtering:

How filtering helps  
As a security analyst, you'll often be responsible for working with very large and complicated security logs. To find the information you need, you'll often need to use SQL to filter the logs.

In a cybersecurity context, you might use filters to find the login attempts of a specific user or all login attempts made at the time of a security issue. As another example, you might filter to find the devices that are running a specific version of an application.

WHERE   
To create a filter in SQL, you need to use the keyword WHERE. WHERE indicates the condition for a filter.

If you needed to email employees with a title of IT Staff, you might use a query like the one in the following example. You can run this example to examine what it returns: 

SELECT firstname, lastname, title, email  
FROM employees  
WHERE title \= 'IT Staff';

Rather than returning all records in the employees table, this WHERE clause instructs SQL to return only those that contain 'IT Staff' in the title column. It uses the equals sign (=) operator to set this condition.

Note: You should place the semicolon (;) where the query ends. When you add a filter to a basic query, the semicolon is after the filter. 

Filtering for patterns  
You can also filter based on a pattern. For example, you can identify entries that start or end with a certain character or characters. Filtering for a pattern requires incorporating two more elements into your WHERE clause:

a wildcard 

the LIKE operator

Wildcards  
A wildcard is a special character that can be substituted with any other character. Two of the most useful wildcards are the percentage sign (%) and the underscore (\_):

The percentage sign substitutes for any number of other characters. 

The underscore symbol only substitutes for one other character.

These wildcards can be placed after a string, before a string, or in both locations depending on the pattern you’re filtering for.

The following table includes these wildcards applied to the string 'a' and examples of what each pattern would return.

Pattern

Results that could be returned

'a%'

apple123, art, a

'a\_'

as, an, a7

'a\_\_' 

ant, add, a1c

'%a'

pizza, Z6ra, a

'\_a'

ma, 1a, Ha

'%a%'

Again, back, a

'\_a\_'

Car, ban, ea7

LIKE  
To apply wildcards to the filter, you need to use the LIKE operator instead of an equals sign (=). LIKE is used with WHERE to search for a pattern in a column. 

For instance, if you want to email employees with a title of either 'IT Staff' or 'IT Manager', you can use LIKE operator combined with the % wildcard:  

SELECT lastname, firstname, title, email  
FROM employees  
WHERE title LIKE 'IT%';

This query returns all records with values in the title column that start with the pattern of 'IT'. This means both 'IT Staff' and 'IT Manager' are returned.

As another example, if you want to search through the invoices table to find all customers located in states with an abbreviation of 'NY', 'NV', 'NS' or 'NT', you can use the 'N\_' pattern on the state column:

SELECT firstname,lastname, state, country  
FROM customers  
WHERE state LIKE 'N\_';

This returns all the records with state abbreviations that follow this pattern.

Numbers, dates, and times in cybersecurity  
Security analysts work with more than just string data, or data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. 

They also frequently work with numeric data, or data consisting of numbers. A few examples of numeric data that you might encounter in your work as a security analyst include:

the number of login attempts

the count of a specific type of log entry

the volume of data being sent from a source

the volume of data being sent to a destination

You'll also encounter date and time data, or data representing a date and/or time. As a first example, logs will generally timestamp every record. Other time and date data might include:

login dates

login times

dates for patches 

the duration of a connection

Comparison operators  
In SQL, filtering numeric and date and time data often involves operators. You can use the following operators in your filters to make sure you return only the rows you need:

operator

use

\<

less than

\>

greater than

\=

equal to

\<=

less than or equal to

\>=

greater than or equal to

\<\>

not equal to

Note: You can also use \!= as an alternative operator for not equal to.

Incorporating operators into filters  
These comparison operators are used in the WHERE clause at the end of a query. The following query uses the \> operator to filter the birthdate column. You can run this query to explore its output:

SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate  
FROM employees  
WHERE birthdate \> '1970-01-01';

This query returns the first and last names of employees born after, but not on, '1970-01-01' (or January 1, 1970). If you were to use the \>= operator instead, the results would also include results on exactly '1970-01-01'.

In other words, the \> operator is exclusive and the \>= operator is inclusive.  An exclusive operator is an operator that does not include the value of comparison. An inclusive operator is an operator that includes the value of comparison. 

BETWEEN  
Another operator used for numeric data as well as date and time data is the BETWEEN operator. BETWEEN filters for numbers or dates within a range. For example, if you want to find the first and last names of all employees hired between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2003, you can use the BETWEEN operator as follows:

SELECT firstname, lastname, hiredate  
FROM employees  
WHERE hiredate BETWEEN '2002-01-01' AND '2003-01-01';

Note: The BETWEEN operator is inclusive. This means records with a hiredate of January 1, 2002 or January 1, 2003 are included in the results of the previous query.

Logical operators  
AND, OR, and NOT allow you to filter your queries to return the specific information that will help you in your work as a security analyst. They are all considered logical operators.

AND   
First, AND is used to filter on two conditions. AND specifies that both conditions must be met simultaneously. 

As an example, a cybersecurity concern might affect only those customer accounts that meet both the condition of being handled by a support representative with an ID of 5 and the condition of being located in the USA. To find the names and emails of those specific customers, you should place the two conditions on either side of the AND operator in the WHERE clause:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid  
FROM customers  
WHERE supportrepid \= 5 AND country \= 'USA';

Running this query returns four rows of information about the customers. You can use this information to contact them about the security concern.

OR   
The OR operator also connects two conditions, but OR specifies that either condition can be met. It returns results where the first condition, the second condition, or both are met.

For example, if you are responsible for finding all customers who are either in the USA or Canada so that you can communicate information about a security update, you can use an OR operator to find all the needed records. As the following query demonstrates, you should place the two conditions on either side of the OR operator in the WHERE clause:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country  
FROM customers  
WHERE country \= 'Canada' OR country \= 'USA';

The query returns all customers in either the US or Canada.

Note: Even if both conditions are based on the same column, you need to write out both full conditions. For instance, the query in the previous example contains the filter WHERE country \= 'Canada' OR country \= 'USA'. 

NOT   
Unlike the previous two operators, the NOT operator only works on a single condition, and not on multiple ones. The NOT operator negates a condition. This means that SQL returns all records that don’t match the condition specified in the query. 

For example, if a cybersecurity issue doesn't affect customers in the USA but might affect those in other countries, you can return all customers who are not in the USA. This would be more efficient than creating individual conditions for all of the other countries. To use the NOT operator for this task, write the following query and place NOT directly after WHERE:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country  
FROM customers  
WHERE NOT country \= 'USA';

SQL returns every entry where the customers are not from the USA.

Pro tip: Another way of finding values that are not equal to a certain value is by using the \<\> operator or the \!= operator. For example, WHERE country \<\> 'USA' and WHERE country \!= 'USA' are the same filters as WHERE NOT country \= 'USA'. 

Combining logical operators  
Logical operators can be combined in filters. For example, if you know that both the USA and Canada are not affected by a cybersecurity issue, you can combine operators to return customers in all countries besides these two. In the following query, NOT is placed before the first condition, it's joined to a second condition with AND, and then NOT is also placed before that second condition. You can run it to explore what it returns:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country  
FROM customers  
WHERE NOT country \= 'Canada' AND NOT country \= 'USA';

## Joins:

Inner joins  
The first type of join that you might perform is an inner join. INNER JOIN returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table.

Venn diagram with two circles labeled "left table" and "right table". The intersection is highlighted.  
It only returns the rows where there is a match, but like other types of joins, it returns all specified columns from all joined tables. For example, if the query joins two tables with SELECT \*, all columns in both of the tables are returned.

Note: If a column exists in both of the tables, it is returned twice when SELECT \* is used.

The syntax of an inner join  
To write a query using INNER JOIN, you can use the following syntax:

SELECT \*

FROM employees

INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device\_id \= machines.device\_id;

You must specify the two tables to join by including the first or left table after FROM and the second or right table after INNER JOIN.

After the name of the right table, use the ON keyword and the \= operator to indicate the column you are joining the tables on. It's important that you specify both the table and column names in this portion of the join by placing a period (.) between the table and the column.  

In addition to selecting all columns, you can select only certain columns.  For example, if you only want the join to return the username, operating\_system and device\_id columns, you can write this query:

SELECT username, operating\_system, employees.device\_id

FROM  employees

INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device\_id \= machines.device\_id;

Note: In the example query, username and operating\_system only appear in one of the two tables, so they are written with just the column name. On the other hand, because device\_id appears in both tables, it's necessary to indicate which one to return by specifying both the table and column name (employees.device\_id).

Outer joins  
Outer joins expand what is returned from a join. Each type of outer join returns all rows from either one table or both tables.

Left joins  
When joining two tables, LEFT JOIN returns all the records of the first table, but only returns rows of the second table that match on a specified column. 

Venn diagram with two circles labeled "left table" and "right table". The left circle and the intersection are highlighted.  
The syntax for using LEFT JOIN is demonstrated in the following query:

SELECT \*

FROM employees

LEFT JOIN machines ON employees.device\_id \= machines.device\_id;

As with all joins, you should specify the first or left table as the table that comes after FROM and the second or right table as the table that comes after LEFT JOIN. In the example query, because employees is the left table, all of its records are returned. Only records that match on the device\_id column are returned from the right table, machines. 

Right joins  
When joining two tables, RIGHT JOIN returns all of the records of the second table, but only returns rows from the first table that match on a specified column. 

Venn diagram with two circles labeled "left table" and "right table". The right circle and the intersection are highlighted.  
The following query demonstrates the syntax for RIGHT JOIN:

SELECT \*

FROM employees

RIGHT JOIN machines ON employees.device\_id \= machines.device\_id;

RIGHT JOIN has the same syntax as LEFT JOIN, with the only difference being the keyword RIGHT JOIN instructs SQL to produce different output. The query returns all records from machines, which is the second or right table. Only matching records are returned from employees, which is the first or left table.

Note:  You can use LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN and return the exact same results if you use the tables in reverse order. The following RIGHT JOIN query returns the exact same result as the LEFT JOIN query demonstrated in the previous section:

SELECT \*

FROM machines

RIGHT JOIN employees ON employees.device\_id \= machines.device\_id;

All that you have to do is switch the order of the tables that appear before and after the keyword used for the join, and you will have swapped the left and right tables.

Full outer joins   
FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables. You can think of it as a way of completely merging two tables.

Venn diagram with two circles labeled "left table" and "right table". Both circles are highlighted  
You can review the syntax for using FULL OUTER JOIN in the following query:

SELECT \*

FROM employees

FULL OUTER JOIN machines ON employees.device\_id \= machines.device\_id;

The results of a FULL OUTER JOIN query include all records from both tables. Similar to INNER JOIN, the order of tables does not change the results of the query.

## More on SQL:

Aggregate functions  
In SQL, aggregate functions are functions that perform a calculation over multiple data points and return the result of the calculation. The actual data is not returned. 

There are various aggregate functions that perform different calculations:

COUNT returns a single number that represents the number of rows returned from your query.

AVG returns a single number that represents the average of the numerical data in a column.

SUM returns a single number that represents the sum of the numerical data in a column. 

Aggregate function syntax  
To use an aggregate function, place the keyword for it after the SELECT keyword, and then in parentheses, indicate the column you want to perform the calculation on.

For example, when working with the customers table, you can use aggregate functions to summarize important information about the table. If you want to find out how many customers there are in total, you can use the COUNT function on any column, and SQL will return the total number of records, excluding NULL values. You can run this query and explore its output:

12  
SELECT COUNT(firstname)  
FROM customers;  
Reset  
The result is a table with one column titled COUNT(firstname) and one row that indicates the count. 

If you want to find the number of customers from a specific country, you can add a filter to your query:

123  
SELECT COUNT(firstname)  
FROM customers  
WHERE country \= 'USA';  
Reset  
With this filter, the count is lower because it only includes the records where the country column contains a value of 'USA'.

There are a lot of other aggregate functions in SQL. The syntax of placing them after SELECT is exactly the same as the COUNT function.

Continuing to learn SQL  
SQL is a widely used querying language, with many more keywords and applications. You can continue to learn more about aggregate functions and other aspects of using SQL on your own.

Most importantly, approach new tasks with curiosity and a willingness to find new ways to apply SQL to your work as a security analyst. Identify the data results that you need and try to use SQL to obtain these results.

Fortunately, SQL is one of the most important tools for working with databases and analyzing data, so you'll find a lot of support in trying to learn SQL online. First, try searching for the concepts you've already learned and practiced to find resources that have accurate easy-to-follow explanations. When you identify these resources, you can use them to extend your knowledge.

Continuing your practical experience with SQL is also important. You can also search for new databases that allow you to perform SQL queries using what you've learned.
