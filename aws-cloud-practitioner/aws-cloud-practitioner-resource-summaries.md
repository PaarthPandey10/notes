## What is Cloud Computing? 

ðŸ“Œ Source: [What is Cloud Computing? \- Cloud Computing Services, Benefits, and Types \- AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)  
Cloud computing means accessing IT resources (like servers, storage, and databases) over the internet.  
 You pay only for what you use, instead of buying and maintaining physical infrastructure.  
 Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the major providers of cloud computing services.  
Who Uses the Cloud  
Cloud is used by all types of organizations across industries:

* Healthcare: Personalized treatments  
* Finance: Real-time fraud detection  
* Gaming: Hosting large-scale online games  
* Other use cases include backups, disaster recovery, virtual desktops, software testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing applications.

Benefits of Cloud Computing  
1\. Agility  
 Access to a wide range of technologies like ML, IoT, databases, etc.  
 Fast deployment allows quick experimentation and faster time-to-market.  
2\. Elasticity  
 Scale up or down instantly based on demand.  
 No need for upfront over-provisioning.  
3\. Cost Savings  
 Pay-as-you-go pricing model.  
 Avoid upfront costs of buying and maintaining data centers.  
 Lower prices due to economies of scale.  
4\. Global Deployment  
 Deploy applications in multiple geographic locations in minutes.  
 Reduces latency and improves user experience.

Types of Cloud Computing  
1\. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  
 Gives access to core IT resources: compute, storage, and networking.  
 Provides maximum flexibility and control.  
2\. Platform as a Service (PaaS)  
 Abstracts the underlying hardware and OS.  
 Focus only on application deployment and management.  
 Reduces operational workload like patching and capacity planning.  
3\. Software as a Service (SaaS)  
 Complete software applications managed by the provider.  
 User only focuses on using the app, not maintaining it.

Customer Examples

* BMW: Reduced translation time by over 75%  
* Coca-Cola: Improved analytics productivity by 80%  
* Epic Games: Supports 350 million+ players  
* Netflix: Streams to over 200 million users globally

What Are Cloud Services  
Cloud services are on-demand IT services provided over the internet.  
 They replace traditional methods of buying and configuring physical infrastructure.  
 Allow for faster development, innovation, and scaling.  
 Include services for AI/ML, analytics, networking, databases, security, and more.

What Are Cloud Managed Services  
Cloud services are also known as cloud managed services because AWS handles all underlying infrastructure.  
 Includes hardware, operating systems, and data center operations.   
AWS manages patching, monitoring, disaster recovery, and load balancing.  
Makes cloud technology accessible to individuals and organizations without large budgets.

Example Use Cases for Cloud Services  
1\. Compute  
 Provision scalable compute power with various CPU types (Intel, AMD, Arm).  
 Options for Mac instances, high-speed networking, and multiple pricing models.  
2\. Databases & Storage  
 Secure, scalable storage: file, block, and object.  
 Managed SQL and NoSQL database options.  
 Simplified scaling, backup, and maintenance.  
3\. AI/ML  
 Tools for chatbots, predictive analytics, image recognition, NLP, and more.  
 Infrastructure supports both training and inference tasks efficiently.  
4\. Networking & Content Delivery  
 Globally deliver content and applications with high availability.  
 Efficient traffic management and hybrid cloud connectivity.  
5\. Security & Compliance  
 Manage permissions and identities.  
 Implement fine-grained security policies.  
 Automated compliance monitoring and data protection services.  
6\. Migration & Modernization  
 Helps move existing apps and data to AWS.  
 Automated tools for conversion, testing, and minimal-downtime migration.  
 Supports digital transformation and adoption of cloud-native technologies.

## Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing lets developers and IT teams avoid tasks like hardware procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning.  
It gives more time to focus on building and scaling applications.  
AWS organizes cloud computing into 3 service models and 3 deployment strategies.

Cloud Service Models  
1\. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  
Provides building blocks like virtual machines, networking, and storage.  
Gives you maximum control and flexibility.  
Closest to traditional IT infrastructure.  
Example use: You manage the OS and apps, AWS manages the hardware.

2\. PaaS (Platform as a Service)  
Removes the need to manage servers or OS.  
You focus only on application logic and deployment.  
No worries about updates, patching, or capacity planning.  
Good for developers who want to code and deploy quickly.

3\. SaaS (Software as a Service)  
Fully functional apps delivered over the internet.  
Vendor handles everything â€” servers, updates, infrastructure.  
You just use the app (like Gmail, Dropbox).  
Great for end-users and businesses that want ready-made solutions.

Deployment Models  
1\. Cloud  
Entire application is built and hosted in the cloud.  
Either developed in the cloud or migrated from traditional infrastructure.  
Can use low-level infrastructure or higher-level services to simplify development.

2\. Hybrid  
Combines on-premise infrastructure with cloud services.  
Common in companies that want to extend existing systems into the cloud.  
Allows gradual migration and better integration with legacy systems.

3\. On-Premises  
Resources are hosted in the organizationâ€™s physical location.  
Often uses virtualization and management tools.  
Offers control and privacy but lacks cloud scalability and flexibility.  
Sometimes used where full cloud adoption isnâ€™t possible.
